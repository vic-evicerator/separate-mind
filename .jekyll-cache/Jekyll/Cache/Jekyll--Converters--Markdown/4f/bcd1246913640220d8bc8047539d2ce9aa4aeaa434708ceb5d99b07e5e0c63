I"Ô<p>He, of course, being the infamous <strong>JASON GORTICIAN</strong>, the man of a thousand screen names. I just happened to catch him on AIM last night after something like 3 years of no contact. As much as things have changed, as the cliche goes, things are still the same. Except that thereâ€™s some slight chance of a Gortician reformation - with new members ;) More details as they arise.</p>

<p><em>Iâ€™ve known Jason since I was on the usenet newsgroups (like alt.rock-n-roll.metal.death) in the mid-90s. I had gotten used to him just dropping off posting for months and then coming back, but once I got off usenet I kinda lost contact - until now, where weâ€™re both on Facebook. But between Usenet and FB he would just pop up now and then, weâ€™d talk for a week, and then BOOM-Gone again. Enthusiasm would overtake me and weâ€™d want to get something done together, and it would never happen. Maybe somedayâ€¦)</em></p>
