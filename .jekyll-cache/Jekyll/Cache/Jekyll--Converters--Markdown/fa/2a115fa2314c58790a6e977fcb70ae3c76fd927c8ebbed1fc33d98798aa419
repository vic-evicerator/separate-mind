I"›<p>Musically, the <em>Misogyny 2</em> EP is finished. Itâ€™ll be mailed off to Aerik tomorrow.</p>

<p>The <em>Misogyny 1</em> rerecording is finished, musically, but still needs mixing/production work. Still, thatâ€™s going quickly as the recording process was pretty pain-free.</p>

<p>Next up - <em>Bellum Aeternum</em>â€¦</p>

<p><em>(I really need to figure out what to do about the misogyny in my older worksâ€¦</em></p>

<p><em>That aside, this was a bit surprising to me, because Michael was born the next month, so Iâ€™m a bit surprised that I re-recorded the entire Bellum album in less than a month. Still, I have my studio log notebook so I went back and looked and, sure enough, it was only about 4 weeks. I recorded the first guitar tracks for Rainbow Skies on 3/16 and finished the last lead guitars, the solos in Nemesis and The Final Day, on 4/13. Itâ€™s not super-duper amazing since all of this had been written and recorded before, and so I was just re-doing things Iâ€™d done before, but I had new takes on a few sections and I was doing the recording only an hour or two a night.</em></p>

<p><em>Thatâ€™s the focus I need to get back to.)</em></p>
