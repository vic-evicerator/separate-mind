I"«<p>I forgot how hard some of this shit was to play. And how FAST some of it was (or, rather, how fast it required me to play tightly). Iâ€™ve been practicing the more troublesome songs on <em>Bellum</em> while recording the easier songs, but Iâ€™m rapidly running out of those.</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™m quite happy with how this is turning out. The previous album was so squashed, production-wise, that this one will â€˜breatheâ€™ a lot more and thus should sound better even if I rerecorded exactly the same parts for everything. Plus the last oneâ€™s source waves were only at 22KHz (due to a small HD), so thatâ€™ll be another plus - as if the better drum synth wasnâ€™t enough on its own.</p>

<p>I may need some help finding a better instrument synth (or at least better patches for the EDIROL VSC Iâ€™m using now). If anyone knows what Iâ€™m talking about and can help, please do.</p>

<p>On the flipside of the worries above, Iâ€™m really stoked about the sounds Iâ€™m getting. Iâ€™m still using the V on some stuff, but the SG is getting quite a workout too, and with my new amp Iâ€™m getting a much better sound. Or sounds, really - Iâ€™m having a lot of fun tweaking the sounds so that each song will have its own sound - â€œSoulswordâ€ will have that SG-rumbling sound like on â€œDispleasuresâ€, while I used tighter, more trebly sounds for faster things like â€œRainbow Skiesâ€. This will be quite a change from my usual MO where Iâ€™m almost anal about making sure every track has exactly the same sound and mix and such. That will make mixing a bit lengthier in the end (since I canâ€™t just plop the same mix setting on each track and export), but will ultimately make for a much stronger product, I think.</p>

<p>Well, back to the salt minesâ€¦.</p>
