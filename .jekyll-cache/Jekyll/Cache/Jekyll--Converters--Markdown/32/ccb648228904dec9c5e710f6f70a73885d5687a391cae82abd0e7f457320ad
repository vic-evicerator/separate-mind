<p>Also, a new tradition in x-mas meals has begun this year. My wife just changed jobs a few months ago, so this is her first xmas at the new job - and on the last day before the holiday, at the company lunch, the bosses handed out their usual xmas gift to every one of the employees. Now, I’ve heard of employers giving away hamhocks or turkeys before - but these classy people gave away entire beef tenderloins! So, instead of the traditional ham-n-turkey crap, the entire family had hand-trimmed tenderloin steak - and there’s still like half a dozen steaks left over. And, apparently, they do this EVERY year. Yummy.</p>
