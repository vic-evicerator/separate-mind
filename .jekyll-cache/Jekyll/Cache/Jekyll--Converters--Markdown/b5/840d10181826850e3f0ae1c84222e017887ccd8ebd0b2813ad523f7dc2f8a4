I"’<p>It was exactly seven years ago today that I saw Death for the last time.</p>

<p>Little did I know it would be the last time ANYONE would see Death.</p>

<p>The last official date of the tour was the previous night, December 12, 1998. I saw the whole tour schedule and was quite pissed that they didnâ€™t have an Atlanta date, but a couple of weeks before, just after thanksgiving that year, I scanned a copy of the â€˜Loaf (Creative Loafing, a local entertainment paper) and saw the show - â€œDEATH AND HAMMERFALL - THE MASQUERADE, DEC. 13â€.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got my ticket, went to the show, and enjoyed it immensely. It helped that everyone was having a good time - I guess because of it being the last night of the tour, they just kept horsing around during the set and afterward, even putting Richard Christy on stage in some fucked-up leotard thing singing for â€œThe Waffleheadsâ€ (Various members of Death and Hammerfall on different instruments than they normally play, all wearing those paper hats the cooks wear at Waffle House), doing a cover of The Perpetratorâ€™s â€œLet Your Tongue Rollâ€. Nothing but smiles and laughs all around.</p>

<p>And then three years later, to the day, I open up my e-mail and read Metal Nightmare zine author Tom Wrenâ€™s eulogy for Chuck Schuldiner. I knew heâ€™d been fighting cancer, but didnâ€™t follow his progress all that closely. I was shocked. And sad. Over the years Iâ€™d seen the band four times. I met various members a couple of times, and even spent a few hours hanging out with Chuck on the tour bus one night through a happy accident of speech.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s become fashionable in some nutless circles to talk shit about him and his accomplishments. All I can say is â€˜fuck themâ€™. From what I could see he was a decent person who had a great gift for playing guitar and songwriting, and while he left us quite a legacy with eight full-length studio albums, the growth from each to the next kept us all wondering â€œwow - whereâ€™s he gonna take this vision next?â€</p>

<p>Where, indeedâ€¦</p>

<p>But as the old guard dies, the new guard steps forward, inspired by those who have gone before. Seeing the changes wrought on the metal landscape in Deathâ€™s wake let us all know that he may be gone, but definitely will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Somehow, that makes my next post all the more fitting, as I can still remember just like it was yesterday how walking into that comics-games-music store on Merrimon Ave. in Asheville NC and buying â€œLeprosyâ€, and hearing it for the first time, changed my vision of what music could be - in fact, changed my very life.</p>

<p><em>(Am I recursive now? Iâ€™m having memories about my memories. I still commemorate his passing and his final show, and Iâ€™m one of only about a lucky 1000 or so who can say that. Itâ€™s poetic that his passing can be tied to his last live show, and itâ€™s satisfying to me that my last memory of him was seeing him have such a great damn time - he was beaming the whole time, just having a blast by having a great record, a great backing band, and a great opener, one that he certainly felt like he could take out with him without worrying about the styles not matching. I still remember him and the other Death guys standing off to the right (if youâ€™ve been to Heaven in The Masquerade, you know that ramp by the door that headed back towards backstage - they were up there) just smiling and getting a kick out of watching Hammerfall playing their hearts out.</em></p>

<p><em>And nothing, I mean NOTHING, in my life will ever erase the memory of Richard Christy in that leotard singing â€œLet your tongue roll over my bunghole - youâ€™re my kind of girl!â€)</em></p>
