I"x<p>That’s right. Not ‘a’ holiday. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Holiday">THE Holiday.</a></p>

<p>But at least I’m not sick like last time.</p>

<p>So, if anyone wonders where I am the next week and why the UHR stuff (which I’m still behind on) is running farther behind, there you go.</p>

<p>Anyone know any good driving games to play while driving across backwater holes like Alabama?</p>

<p><em>(Rather than apologize again for not being busier with music, I’ll note that the link above is different from the first time I posted it - because in all of the years since then, which honestly hasn’t been too many years in the grand scheme of things, “The Holiday” was sold to a Portuguese cruise line and is now the “Grand Holiday” for another company. I would say it’s weird that things change, but what would really be weird is if they didn’t. It’s like driving through your childhood neighborhood as an adult - yes, you grew, it didn’t shrink, but there are new buildings, bigger trees, more cracks in the pavement…</em></p>

<p><em>Or, in this case, a new flag on the pole.)</em></p>
