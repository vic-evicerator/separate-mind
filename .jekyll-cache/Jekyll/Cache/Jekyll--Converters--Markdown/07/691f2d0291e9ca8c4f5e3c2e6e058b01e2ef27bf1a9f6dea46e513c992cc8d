I"ï<p>And after one week, how much of my list did I get done?</p>

<ul>
  <li>updating the ADR webstore with about a monthâ€™s worth of new shit</li>
</ul>

<p>But the Protoss and Zerg have been getting their ASSES KICKED!</p>

<p>Fortunately, we managed to dodge the storm, and the last round of repairs to fix the perpetual leak in our house seems to have worked - if we made it through the remnants of a Cat. 4 storm without a drop in the kitchen, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s a success. Except Iâ€™ve said it was a success three times before. So I guess Iâ€™ll reserve judgement.</p>

<p>Also fortunately, Iâ€™m about to go off for a week-plus of fun-n-sun at Hilton Head with the family. Last yearâ€™s trip was cut way too short, so itâ€™ll be nice to have a full week there this year - and I think the weather will be better this time around (at least I hope so - last time it WAS a hurricaneâ€¦and the house leaked. Funny how history is a bunch of circlesâ€¦).</p>

<p>Really, itâ€™s not quite so dire on the songwriting front. Misogyny II is about ready to get recorded, and now that the DB album is in the hands of Black Goat I finally cleaned off my recording PC hard drive to get ready for the wealth of new recordings Iâ€™m about to indulge in.</p>

<p>I also learned how to clean viruses/spyware off of a laptop. Donâ€™t ask.</p>

<p>So, at least the next semi-long absence will be explained. See you all laterâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(And while this post may seem at odds with my recollections at the end of the last post, keep in mind that in ONE week I did the biggest single task I ever had to do on a regular basis while also fixing a sick PC AND taking care of house repairs. Again, those disparate life threads weave together, and while only a little bit shows to certain people, only I see it all - but, if you look, you can see where threads from one area tug on other areas. I try to keep that in mind when looking at other people, not in a creepy way but in a â€˜hey, letâ€™s cut â€˜em some slackâ€™ kind of way.)</em></p>
