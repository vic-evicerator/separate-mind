<p>I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen, except that, as stated here, Misogyny II and Letters From Hell will be completed. Crimson Frost is (still) in the final mixing stages. More details as they comeâ€¦.</p>

<p>And as for Aerikâ€™s speculation, I still havenâ€™t dealt with the news as it is, much less thought about â€˜what next?â€™â€¦ so I guess youâ€™ll find out when I doâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(The Wayback Machine wasnâ€™t much help the first time I searched, but in doing these histories I found that he only deleted the one entry, not the whole history of his blog. The entry I found from him on the next day, Feb. 6, doesnâ€™t quite explain it, but refers to it. Iâ€™ll paste it in below another split in a second. Now that Iâ€™ve found this, I do remember him talking now and again about giving it all up - creation was hard on him, because he really puts everything into everything he writes and does. Kinda like Jim Morrison, you have to keep pushing the boundaries, even if itâ€™s dangerous, because thatâ€™s where the truth, and true art, really lie, and if youâ€™re not going for something true then whatâ€™s the fucking point?</em></p>

<p><em>No wonder Aerik and I got on so well together while we were together. Anyway, what follows the next split is Aerikâ€™s post, preserved here in case it disappears.)</em></p>

<p>(from Aerik Von, 2/6/2005):</p>

<p>People ask me about my constant threat of quitting music. I think people need to understand that music for me is a rather heavy process. I create, I coerce and I force ideas into shape. I take my music very seriously as my songs are very much a representation of me. I donâ€™t often see myself as an entertainer, Iâ€™d rather be seen as someone who paints a picture with sound. Itâ€™s not easy pursuing music, itâ€™s not even pleasent a lot of the time. Most fans draw strength for the music, I draw from my strength to create it.</p>

<p>Other than a few joke numbers my music has been pretty serious. One may point at â€œThe Scorpion Kingâ€ and giggle at itâ€™s rather odd lyricsâ€¦but on a whole thatâ€™s not what I do. Songs like â€œRaining Hellâ€, â€œDispleasures of the Fleshâ€, â€œAgainst the Sunâ€ and â€œBuilt to Burnâ€ are all pretty direct messages pertaining to things I am seeing/dealing with. Itâ€™s not even pretentious as many, itâ€™s simply what fascinates me. I canâ€™t write about dragons, and the devil only comes out when Iâ€™m feeling to channel that which is darker than black.</p>

<p>Man cannot write music without having energy or passion for it. When I get weakened, or something happens of this magnitude I feel a crippling lack of passion that makes music seem artificial when released from my hands/fingers/voice and into action. It feels dead, and itâ€™s a horrible feeling. To perform a song while feeling this way feels like holding on to the corpse of someone you love and attempting to pretend they live.</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to look at that realityâ€¦and if itâ€™s difficult for you to understand. Try creating things. Try creating things that MATTER to you. Itâ€™s easy to write â€œa songâ€, itâ€™s hard to write/perform something that requires you to give a piece of yourself. Something much deeper. Then youâ€™ll know what Iâ€™ve tried to do, and why sometimes I want to leave it behind. When you feel no fire to live, you certainly feel less to create.</p>

<p>Art is not an abstract to the artistâ€¦that IS the point. The artist creates, and he knows what he creates. If an artists claims he is creating when all he is doing is dumping all over the placeâ€¦this artist needs to get his shit together and realize a VISION. I do this a lotâ€¦itâ€™s often more important to me to create this vision than to eat.</p>

<p>Hopefully youâ€™ll stop judging me for these emotional outbursts as I actually believe in my art and I put myself into it enough that I need something to refuel me. When the fuel isnâ€™t thereâ€¦I feel I canâ€™t go on and itâ€™s horribly draining to say you will.</p>

<p>For the recordâ€¦I never said I would quit metalâ€¦making metal and loving metal are too different things. The end of creation is relatively different than saying â€œI hate the genreâ€ or that â€œmetal is deadâ€.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know if I CAN really stopm, even if I wanted to. Iâ€™ve made metal/been involved with music for longer than most people have known what they wanted to do with their lives. This is something people need to seeâ€¦and understand that since I was 14 this music was the soundtrack I worked with (and now create) to back up a lifestyle and philosophy of living. When those donâ€™t seem possibleâ€¦the soundtrack seems and empty reminder.</p>

<p>Think about itâ€¦</p>
