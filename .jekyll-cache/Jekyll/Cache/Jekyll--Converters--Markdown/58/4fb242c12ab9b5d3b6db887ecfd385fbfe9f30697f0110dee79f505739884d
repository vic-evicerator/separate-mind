I"û<p>Yep, Iâ€™ve earned it. Three days ago I mailed off the <em>Devilution</em> masters and artwork to Suffering Jesus Productions. Itâ€™s LITERALLY only a matter of time until this baby comes out. A lifeâ€™s goal, already accomplished.</p>

<p>The icing on this cake is that Death Beast is finally out of my studio too - I finished the final mix and mailed it to Black Goat the same day I mailed off the <em>Devilution</em> stuff. For the first time in three years, I have no currently-active recording projects going on - itâ€™s all writing.</p>

<p>But first, Iâ€™m gonna kick back, relax, and enjoy these laurels for a little bit. Theyâ€™re rather comfy.</p>

<p><em>(Of course I remember well how SJP fucked us over by not releasing this - but until I re-dug this post up I forgot we had gotten all the way to mailing them the masters and artwork. I also forgot that I had â€œDevilutionâ€ and the first Death Beast album going out right at the same time. I guess I was happy - for a little while.)</em></p>
