I".<p>For the new year, I’ve given the UHR site a facelift with the latest update.</p>

<p>http://unsungheroesrecords.cjb.net/  (Dead Link)</p>

<p>The news is on the main page, but one item I’d like to draw attention to: CONTESTS!</p>

<p>http://www.mindspring.com/~lordvic/uhr/contest.htm  (Dead Link)</p>

<p>Basically, Rampage wants to do T-shirts, and we want cover art for our upcoming rehearsal demo Fucked Raw, so we’re running contests for each, with the winners getting some free swag.</p>

<p>(also, there’s an unofficial third contest - anyone who can make a UHR logo like the top of the pages but make it look metallic instead of just gray. No prize here but gratitude and bragging rights, unfortunately…)</p>

<p><em>(I never did get any entries for any of these contests…)</em></p>
