I"€<p>Look at the first post of this blog, and notice that itâ€™s almost exactly two years ago, and I was saying exactly the same thing as I am now. I really need to work on this thing, as with so many other things, and so I decide to try to regularly do SOMETHING, hoping against hope that building any sort of structure of creativity will spread to other areas.</p>

<p>After all, only one live gig and a few demo tracks after six years is unconscionable.</p>

<p>So, stay tuned here. More is coming, both here and elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>(As you can see, this is a long-running trend of mine. I start with a flurry of activity and then fail to follow-through, only occasionally looking back to realize how little I did of what I actually wanted to do. This was the ninth blog post on that second music blog, over a span of two years and two days. Even for me, that was pathetic.)</em></p>
