I"ð<p>Yes, many years too late, I finally added a dedicated page to the UHR site for links to audio samples. A couple of direct MP3 links are there, but most are links to sound-loaded websites (Audiostreet, Myspace, etc.)</p>

<p>http://www.mindspring.com/~uhr/ (Dead Link)</p>

<p>Enjoy. More stuff coming soon (I was just working on layouts earlier today as a matter of factâ€¦)</p>

<p><em>(I remember building this sample page, trying to make a more robust online presence - and I remember it so well because that was the page I stripped to the bones and recoded when I moved, again, to the Internet Archive for posting music online. I still have some work to do getting more stuff uploaded, but at least itâ€™s progress, of a sort.)</em></p>
