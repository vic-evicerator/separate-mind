I"m<p>As of today, I have half a bass track and two songs worth of lead guitar to finish. I rattled off most of the bass tracks today in about four hours of playing hooky.</p>

<p>But I won’t have time for any new material, nor do I think I could find a ‘space’ in the story to fit a new song anyway, so new material will have to wait until the next album.</p>

<p>Also, the new kid probably won’t wait until April 21. He might not even wait until next week…</p>

<p><em>(That answers that - I think my ‘ideas’ from earlier were just my usual way of saying “I’m thinking about X”. I must have been getting more busy, because I don’t have many notes in my notebook journal about what was keeping me from finishing right here. I wouldn’t finish those aforementioned tracks for another 8 days.)</em></p>
