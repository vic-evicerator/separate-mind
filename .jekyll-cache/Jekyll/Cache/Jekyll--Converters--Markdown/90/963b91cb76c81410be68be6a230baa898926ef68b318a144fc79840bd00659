I":<p>Damn, every time I want to write in here it’s too late to put anything coherent together.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>

<p><em>(Again, weird that I would put so little here. Though I guess the link to Audiostreet was relevant. It was one of many music-sharing sites that sprang up in the wake of the demise of mp3.com, and it had some nice social features from what I remember.</em></p>

<p><em>However, audiostreet is now dead as well. It redirects to some shit like 561media, a company that builds websites. It’s like driving through your old neighborhood, where you lived and played with your friends, and finding that they paved the whole thing over for a new Wally World.)</em></p>
