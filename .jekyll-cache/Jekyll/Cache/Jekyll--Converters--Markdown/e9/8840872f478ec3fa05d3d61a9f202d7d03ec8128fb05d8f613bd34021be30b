<p><em>(Though I wonder sometimes why I bother. Still, it’s interesting to think about. I certainly didn’t write that thinking that I’d be going back nearly ten years later to revisit the post. But then we remember the weirdest things, both about others and about ourselves. How often do we go about our day doing normal things and think “hey, someone is going to remember this ten years from now” ? I know I don’t…)</em></p>
