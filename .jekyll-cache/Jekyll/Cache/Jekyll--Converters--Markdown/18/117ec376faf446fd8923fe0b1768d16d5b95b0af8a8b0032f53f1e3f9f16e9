I"—<p>Yep, itâ€™s pretty much official. Suffering Jesus has decided to pass on releasing <em>Devilution</em>, meaning that, once again, Crimson Frost seems destined for the vault rather than the store shelf. Any regular readers of Aerikâ€™s blog have seen most of the reasoning and his thoughts on it. Iâ€™m still deciding how to put mine, but more comments will come up later, thatâ€™s for sure.</p>

<p>Also, some professional stuff in both my food-job and my music job have been keeping me from updating this. Some of the music stuff I just mentioned above. More will have to be discussed later, as thereâ€™s still some developments that are up in the air.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I start recording <em>Misogyny II</em> in a week or two. Survive or perish.</p>

<p>We expect the Misantropical Painforest CDs back from the plant in about a week and a half, so stay tuned on that front.</p>

<p>For now, that is all.</p>

<p><em>(Thatâ€™s one of the shoes dropping. I was so fucking pissed, and even though Iâ€™m happier now with the way UHR handled the release, Iâ€™m still mad about it. I still have the letter she sent us and my response to it, and I even have the AIM chat saved between Aerik and I where we discuss her flakiness. Iâ€™ll have to update this post one day - and while it may smack of speaking ill of the dead, since itâ€™s the label thatâ€™s dead and not a person my conscience would be clear.)</em></p>
