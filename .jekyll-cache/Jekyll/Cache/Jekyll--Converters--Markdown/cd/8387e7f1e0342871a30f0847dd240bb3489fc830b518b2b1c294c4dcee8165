<p><em>(Heh - EVERY link listed above is now dead. Funny how that works. I still need to get these posted on the UHR web archive site. I was just happy to have it out, so I find it strange but understandable that I wasnâ€™t more happy at being able to announce itâ€™s release. It felt more like â€˜finallyâ€™ than â€˜hey, new stuff, check it out!â€™)</em></p>
