I"Õ<p>â€¦ but not without reason. Iâ€™ve been busy. With the impending release of <em>Crimson Frost</em>, Iâ€™ve been busy with layouts, mastering, last-minute touchups, and the like. Just last night, in fact, I recorded the intro and outro - both derived from a piece Iâ€™ve had written for quite some time but didnâ€™t know what to do with. Between these last-minute polishes and general life stuff there hasnâ€™t been much time for blogging. Hopefully this will make up for this release being about a year late.</p>

<p>(Though, as already discussed, that isnâ€™t really our faultâ€¦).</p>

<p>If you want a preview of this release, Aerik posted the new version of â€œRitual Curseâ€ on his Serpentine Lust Productions Myspace page: http://www.myspace.com/serpentinelustproductions. (Dead Link)</p>

<p>Also, weâ€™ve been looking ahead to the NEXT Rampage release, the rehearsal demo <em>Fucked Raw</em>. But that will warrant its own postâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(Ah, another one of those dead links. Myspaceâ€¦ oh, man, I remember only that it was so bad that I barely interacted on it and then let mine go dormant. Aerik was made of stronger stuff than I, though, hence the link above. But I guess even that took its tollâ€¦)</em></p>
