I"Ê<p>For a change, vacation was disaster-free. A good time was had by all, we stayed as long as we planned, and our house didnâ€™t leak. Very relaxing.</p>

<p>Until Monday morning when I saw the pile of work that had hit my work-email inboxâ€¦ but I guess thatâ€™s what they call job security.</p>

<p>The big list of things a couple of posts down is still hanging over me like a sword of damocles, but progress is being made on all fronts - and a few new developments that need integration into the already-mounting pile of stuff to do. What is â€˜job securityâ€™ at work is just a â€˜pain in the assâ€™ at home. Still, as the french say, â€˜such is lifeâ€™. (Of course, they had to rip off Robbie Neville to do itâ€¦)</p>

<p>I WILL say this much, at least, right nowâ€¦ it seems Iâ€™ll STILL be a distributor for Barbarian Wrath, in some capacity. But the details will have to wait until I make a molehill out of this mountain of work in front of meâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(Again, those threads from other areas are poking through, but I also see the note regarding distributing Barbarian Wrath titles. When looking at broad strokes you miss details, but one thing Iâ€™ve noticed in re-posting all of these daily (heh) journals is that the reverse is just as true - Iâ€™d forgotten about a good deal of this label business. At the time I was just focused on doing trades, mailing off orders, listening to new stock so I could describe it properly on the store websiteâ€¦</em></p>

<p><em>Missing the details and wanting to appreciate them is the impetus of a lot of blogging. I guess the desire to put those details into broader strokes and bigger contexts is the impetus behind biographies. Maybe itâ€™s time I started mine?)</em></p>
