<p>It is, indeed, a brand new year, and we rang it in in a suitably decadent manner. Family, friends, food, and drinking.</p>

<p>With the new year comes resolutions, of course, and Iâ€™ve alluded to one set of resolutions already, but Iâ€™m making it official here - I resolve to have the following releases recorded by the end of April:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rampage - Misogyny 2</li>
  <li>Rampage - Fucked Raw</li>
  <li>Rampage - Bellum Aeternum</li>
  <li>Rampage - one more thing TBA</li>
</ul>

<p>And, by the end of the year, I hope to have finished (or at least written and mostly underway recording-wise) Death Beast <em>The Onslaught</em>.</p>

<p>Now you all have more basis for bitching at me if it doesnâ€™t happen - and Iâ€™ll do my best to keep you from bitching.</p>

<p><em>(The â€˜one more thing TBAâ€™ was a rerecording of all the songs from the first Misogyny EP - with the plan originally to have both the new one and the full rerecording on a single disc.</em></p>

<p><em>And, in unusual form, I DID keep the bulk of this promise - I finished all of those Rampage recordings by the beginning of April. I knew our second son was due at the end of April, so I had a deadline, and the thinking was to backlog releases I could dole out slowly while the new kid grew to where he wasnâ€™t quite so much work, and so by the end of the year I could be recording and writing again.</em></p>

<p><em>Best laid plans and all that. Nobody told me that effort with kids wasnâ€™t linear, and was instead exponential. And theyâ€™re MORE work once they get to school, not less.</em></p>

<p><em>Oh, and for the few who didnâ€™t know, the quote was from the movie <strong>Better Off Dead</strong>, one of my comedy favorites.)</em></p>
