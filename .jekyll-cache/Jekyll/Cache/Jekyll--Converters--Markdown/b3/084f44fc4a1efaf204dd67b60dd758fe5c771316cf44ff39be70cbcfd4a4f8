I"ç<p>Just added some functionality when I saw how much crap Iâ€™ve put into my Live Journal here. Iâ€™ve started using the â€œMemoriesâ€ function to highlight and organize the more important informational posts so that they donâ€™t get lost in the mists of time. Posts about lyrics, songs or albums, Rampage as a whole (history, that is, not news updates), and essays or essay series are Memories categories so you can somewhat quickly find those posts more easily.</p>

<p>If you use it, let me know what you think and if there need to be any improvements in categorization to make it more useful for you.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, almost got the Black Sabbath essay series done, and I think itâ€™s time to post some more lyricsâ€¦ :)</p>

<p><em>(Of course, as we all know, â€˜Memoriesâ€™ were superseded by tags, but again little housekeeping notes like this are glimpses into the day-to-day that is largely invisible to most of us, and that we really only notice when something changes.)</em></p>
