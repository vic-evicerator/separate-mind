I"µ<p>Itâ€™s been a busy week, which I hope you could intuit from my week of silence here (that is, I hope youâ€™d think â€œman, he must be busyâ€ rather than â€œman, that lazy fucker is wasting time on video gamesâ€¦â€). In addition to family overhead and Valentineâ€™s Day plans, I had to paint the new babyâ€™s room, which ate up most of the weekend.</p>

<p>Still, though, I got hit with some inspiration last night and finished off almost all the guitar parts to the Misogyny 2 EP. At first I thought Iâ€™d just scratch out the last song, but the tracks turned out to be keepers, and went faster than I thought, so I kept goingâ€¦ In my sleep-deprived state, by the end, I forgot the solo intro on one of the songs, but other than that the guitars are done. About one more week and the bass and drums will be finished and Aerik will have his hands on that one as well.</p>

<p>And heâ€™s already started sinking his teeth into â€œFucked Rawâ€ - I just received word he finished one song already.</p>

<p>Next up, the rerecording of the first Misogyny EP. Then Bellum.</p>

<p><em>(At the time, I would finish discs, mail them to Aerik, and he would take them to the home studio of whoever he was working with at the moment. By this time he had moved on from Andrew and Agnosisâ€™s workspace and was recording with the Tonalezzi brothers from Cerbero, when he was fronting BMR, Rampage, and was going to front Cerbero as well. This particular reference I remember well, because he messaged me and told me the story - heâ€™d had a hard day, was pissed off, and supposedly as catharsis he ripped out what he said was a brutal version of the Sabbath cover we did for this, â€œKilling Yourself To Liveâ€.</em></p>

<p><em>I still havenâ€™t heard it. I think odd tracks are done here and there on his various friends and former bandmatesâ€™ computers and tape reels. Thereâ€™s gold in them thar hills, if only we could find where itâ€™s stashed. Oh well.)</em></p>
