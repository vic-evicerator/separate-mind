I"v<p>As in the music has been recorded some time ago, and vocal studio time is booked. This bitch will be done quite soon.</p>

<p>And, just to tease, the instrumental intro to the EP, “GHB”, has been put online at the Rampage Myspace page - http://www.myspace.com/rampage (Dead Link)</p>

<p>Enjoy, and await the rest.</p>

<p><em>(If Aerik really got as far as I assumed he did every time he told me “dude, I’ve almost got it done”, then there are probably half a dozen finished versions of this EP on various recording tapes and PCs scattered around Brooklyn. This time I thought it was imminent, because he’s the one who managed that Rampage Myspace page and he’s the one who posted GHB, which is the instrumental opener to the EP.</em></p>

<p><em>I REALLY must finish that off someday, but it’ll have to be with some newer lyrics. And a new title.)</em></p>
