I"…<p>The radio interview on Radio Glendon was a success, I think. Many, many thanks to the Lousy Lout and Satanicharisma for the publicity option. As you may or may not have seen from Aerikâ€™s blog, their CBGB show got cancelled due to a flaky drummer, so we were hyping something that didnâ€™t exist. :( Ah wellâ€¦</p>

<p>For any who couldnâ€™t make it, we have an mp3 of the interview slot, and the songs they played were Displeasures/The Final Day/Rampage (WS version) before and the new versions of Black Flames and Ritual Curse afterward.</p>

<p>Anyway, the final mixes of Crimson Frost will be coming this week or next, and so I begin the process of making the packaging and looking around for duplication options. Since I hate burning discs, Iâ€™m really thinking pro-CDR for this, with the shrinkwrap/jewlecase/whole nine yards. I probably wonâ€™t have to charge more than like $6 for it, either, which is good.</p>

<p>The next big thing for me, of course, is both finishing the Death Beast album for those guys and recording the bass for Chemikiller. Fortunately Iâ€™m working on two different machines for both of those projects so one wonâ€™t get in the way of the other and I can truly work on them in parallel. I want these done quickly because the next Rampage is really quite ready to get worked on in earnest, but now is a time to clean my plate before piling more shit on it.</p>

<p><em>(Ah, the arrogance of youth. It turns out that Crimson Frost wouldnâ€™t be out for another year, no thanks to, well, you know, and of course the Chemikiller thing wouldnâ€™t work out either.</em></p>

<p><em>Iâ€™d forgotten that the final recording of the first Death Beast album was still a ways in the future. I know it was released September 2005, but strange to see that it was so soon that we still hadnâ€™t even started our final studio sessions. Man, when did I ever have that much free time?)</em></p>
