I"ñ<p>Yep, publicity is coming, big time. Two big breaks in the near future (one nearer than the other):</p>

<p>1) TOMORROW, Jan 21, 2005 - Rampage will have a virtual release party for the upcoming ‚ÄúCrimson Frost‚Äù EP when it is broadcast LIVE on Toronto‚Äôs CKRG, Radio Glendon 89.9 FM. The show will be webcast as well, with the link to the live feed available from Radio Glendon‚Äôs website, http://www.radioglendon.com/ (Dead Link)</p>

<p>The show starts at 9pm EST (GMT-5), and Metal Lucifer from the show will give me a call about 9:30 EST (GMT-5) for an interview. Give it a listen every week anyway, as it‚Äôs a hard-hitting metal show and the DJs have EXELLENT taste in metal - and I‚Äôd say that even if they weren‚Äôt playing our new EP.</p>

<p>2) This one is on the newsstands. Rampage and many other UHR bands will be featured in the Apocalyptic Raids column in the July 2005 issue of <strong>METAL MANIACS</strong>. Be sure to pick that one up. The columnist, Nathan Birk, gives UHR a mini-spotlight as he discusses the label and many of the bands on it, and he also gives some verbiage to Alpha Draconis Records and the two albums out on it in that same column.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I‚Äôm pretty happy about it all :)</p>

<p><em>(The interview went well, as those of you with UHR Sampler IV have heard. The Metal Maniacs spread was nice too. I need to post scans of those. Thanks Nathan.)</em></p>
