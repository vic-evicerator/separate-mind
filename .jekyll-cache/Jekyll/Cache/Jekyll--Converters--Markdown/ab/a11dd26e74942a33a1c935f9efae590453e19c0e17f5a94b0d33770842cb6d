I"º<p>Yep - check the dates - exactly THREE MONTHS since I last posted in my revamped, revitalized blog that I swore would get me reinvigorated for diving back into my music ‚Äòcareer‚Äô. Sure, they happen to be the three biggest social/family/bullshit event months of the year, but they also have a high degree of time off, slackness-allowances with work, and a general relaxed atmosphere that should have allowed me to make some progress on <em>The Onslaught</em>.</p>

<p>Well, to be perfectly honest without gilding the turd, I DID get some stuff done, just not as much as I wanted.</p>

<p>Thanks to Xmas gifts, I finally got my old music-working laptop back, which means that all of my effort on getting Magix Music Studio working on DOSBOX was for naught. That laptop still has Vista, which will still run Magix as a native program, and at a much more easy-to-use 1280x800. I spent most of early January collating my various lyric-snippet and tab files along with my multiple drum program files and finally put them all together in one single ‚ÄúHERE IS THE ALBUM YOU‚ÄôRE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON, DUMBASS‚Äù spot on said laptop.</p>

<p>In the course of doing so, I found two snippets of lyrics that I had commissioned from two separate friends. One is farther along than the other, but both need a bit of work and a lot of music.</p>

<p>I also managed to get a trial run of guitars and drums recorded with the new studio setup, basically scratch tracks/proof of concept that my upgraded computer can still work even though my DR808 software became obsolete. Doing this, of course, revealed that one of my guitars needs a shit-ton of setup work done on it - the intonation on it is totally off, so that even though both guitars were in tune on open strings, the whole track was out of tune on every fretted note.</p>

<p>Like I said, I‚Äôm making progress, but not as much as I‚Äôd hoped.</p>

<p>At the turn of the year I planned to get one new song done by the end of January. That didn‚Äôt happen, but even 20% (rough estimate of how much the newest song is completed so far) is better than zero. So, I aim higher and try harder.</p>

<p>And the studio diary will be coming here soon. Look for more frequent updates now.</p>
