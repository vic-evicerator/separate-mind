<p>â€¦ and havenâ€™t really been able to stop thinking about it. â€œItâ€, of course, being the murder of Diamond/Dimebag Darrell. As some of you who know me may know, I used to run a â€œPanterribleâ€ band site where I posted all sorts of pictures and ranting about their glam days and their modern-day denial of it. So why does it bother me?</p>

<p>I may not have cared for his music but I sure as shit didnâ€™t want him dead. Thatâ€™s just plain childish. People hate my music - should they want to kill me over it?</p>

<p>As Snxke said, take the band feelings out of the equation - someone was murdered at a gig, and the incident ended up with others, some in the crowd, dead as well. Over what? Because he was upset Pantera broke up? I may never play a gig again, but I have in the past, and to think of that happening right thereâ€¦ disturbing. Even more so to think of the audience - Iâ€™ve seen far more gigs than Iâ€™ve played, obviouslyâ€¦ again, disturbing. (Someone on a board pointed out that youâ€™re still statistically more likely to die in a car accident than getting gunned down at a gig - that ignores the fact that driving assumes the risk, and youâ€™re in control and can do something about threats - who the hell goes to a gig thinking â€œHm, looks like rain of bullets tonight, I better get my flak jacketâ€¦â€) What will this mean for the future of club shows? Metal shows or music shows in general?</p>

<p>Finally, just one last thought I originally wrote on another message board about this that somehow got lost in the shuffle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And lest anyone think Iâ€™m crying over this, thatâ€™s not exactly the reaction. Itâ€™s more detached but more visceral than that - hard to explain. I just went through this shit last week when the guy who works in the cubicle next to me died over the weekend. Someoneâ€™s there, and then theyâ€™re gone, and that fact just smacks you in the face with the reality that death is coming for YOU, too. You just donâ€™t know when or how. Like the lottery, but in reverse - everyoneâ€™s going to get their number, but nobody wants it, and would prefer not to think about it - and when something like this happens, it becomes impossible NOT to think about it, stare at your own ticket, and wonder â€œHm, when are THOSE numbers going to drop out of the hopperâ€¦?â€</p>

<p><em>I still hate the Phil-era of Pantera, but that old shit fucking rocks. â€œItâ€™s all over tonight!!!â€)</em></p>
