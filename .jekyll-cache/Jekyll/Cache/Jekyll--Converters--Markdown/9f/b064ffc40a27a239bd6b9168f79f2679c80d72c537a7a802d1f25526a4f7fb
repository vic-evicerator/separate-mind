I"ö<p>Today it is done.</p>

<p>After poring through the master tapes, adjusting mixes, dealing with shitty â€˜bassistsâ€™, the final tracks selected for Fucked Raw have been mixed, burned, and mailed to Aerik for vocalization.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s some good stories to go with the recording of this rehearsal demo and how it all came about, but I have to save SOMETHING for the liner notes.</p>

<p>The clock is ticking with about 10-11 weeks left to do two EPs and <em>Bellum</em>. Can I make it?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll seeâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(Fucked Raw was two rehearsal tracks that ballooned up to eight. Again, a story I must expand on some day. It bridged the gap between the tail end of the Crimson Frost recordings of the Misogyny II EP. Earlier today {7/29/2006 as I write this addendum} I found an old studio notes notebook that has the dates of these recordings of early 2006. The notes donâ€™t start until March 2006, but I make references to these rehearsal recordings, all of which were done basically through January 2006, with the final mixes taking up this week.</em></p>

<p><em>Again, the fictional history I created ended up tweaking the narrative I tell here, where freshly-recorded rehearsal tracks became â€˜tracks we recorded in various rehearsals last year that I dug up for releaseâ€™. Itâ€™s a shame we never got this stuff released. A few of these turned out worse in a few ways, from egregious mess-ups to an out-of-tune rhythm guitar, but a few turned out better than the real studio versions.)</em></p>
