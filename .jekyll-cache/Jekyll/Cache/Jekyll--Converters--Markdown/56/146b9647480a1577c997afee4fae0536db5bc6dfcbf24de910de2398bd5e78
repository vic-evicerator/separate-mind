I"€	<p>Barbarian Wrath Vinland is closed.</p>

<p>Yep, almost exactly three years ago, Black Goat asked me to run his North American outpost distro, and I took to the job with glee. Higher profile, more sales, and more money than I was making with my UHR distro, and direct access to first runs of Barbarian Wrath and Witches Brew titles to boot‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And now, three years later, BWV closes its doors as BG brings all of the sales to his home office.</p>

<p>Of course, I won‚Äôt stop running a distro - I have TWO labels to sell for now, and have been getting wholesale/trades from other sources as well over the past three years. Thus, Alpha Draconis Records will be the new host for the distro.</p>

<p>The grand opening will coincide with the next ADR release, Misantropical Painforest <em>Winds Saturate With Inhumane Longing</em>, which is due back from the plant next week.</p>

<p>If you care to help, please spam the ADR website out: http://www.alphadraconisrecords.org/ (Dead Link) The site will get updated upon the MP album release and that‚Äôs when the store opens. So stay tuned, and ‚ÄúThank you for patronizing me all these years.‚Äù*</p>

<p><em>(At the time I thought this was more bad news than it ended up being - since as you‚Äôll see a few months later I was still the official North American distro for BW/WB titles, and since he was releasing our Death Beast album a few months later too I really had nothing to complain about.</em></p>

<p><em>Really, this was a blessing in disguise since it allowed us to keep a higher percentage of sales, and we kept our old customer base which helped ADR as well - and the timing couldn‚Äôt have been better because we were just about to put out our best release ever.</em></p>

<p><em>I guess the main reason I took it hard was that I really felt like a contributor of the BW family. I was fans of bands on his labels before I even knew him personally, and now whenever any enterprising future journalist tells the long, sordid tale of Nazgul‚Äôs Eyrie and Barbarian Wrath, my name will be in it as well. It was a great honor, and I didn‚Äôt want to see it end. But, the grave awaits us all, and I guess these smaller endings along the way are opportunities to get used to that fact.</em></p>

<p><em>Oh yeah, and speaking of endings - another one of those dead links hanging out there like a bad old school snapshot. I really ought to see about reposting that site.)</em></p>
