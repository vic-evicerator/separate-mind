I"Ù<p>Yes, sometimes the progress of life FORCES the end of procrastination. And thus good news mixes with bad.</p>

<p>The ‚Äòbad‚Äô news is that I must BUST MY ASS to finish mixing the Venom tracks and Bellum Aeternum in the next couple of weeks. Pronto.</p>

<p>The ‚Äògood‚Äô news is the reason why - after six years of obsolescence, I‚Äôm finally getting a new PC.</p>

<p>Not just ‚Äògetting‚Äô, though - I‚Äôm going to build it myself. I‚Äôve been reading up on hardware websites, reading how-to books, and in the not-too distant past watched my pop-in-law build his own. It‚Äôs not beyond me, I don‚Äôt think. It should be fun.</p>

<p>See, since we had a second kid last year, but never adjusted our withholdings, we got back a shitload more money than we expected this year. Even after the regular savings portion and stocking away an extra-large part for family vacation, I‚Äôve got about $1500 to throw at this thing. So far, the things I‚Äôve picked out are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU - Intel Core 2 Duo E6300</li>
  <li>Motherboard - Intel DP965LT</li>
  <li>Hard Drive - Seagate Barracuda SATA 7800RPM (size unsure - 160 or 250. Or maybe 2x160. The board does support RAID, after all‚Ä¶)</li>
  <li>Memory - 2X1GB Crucial (board can run memory in dual-channel)</li>
  <li>Board has embedded sound, but I‚Äôll also be adding my Maya44, assuming it works with such new hardware</li>
  <li>OS - Win XP Pro (Vista is still too new)</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll be dragging my Pioneer DVR111 dual-format DVD/CD writer over to serve as my optical drive. For an office suite I‚Äôm thinking about trying OpenOffice instead of paying the Micro$oft tax for ‚Äòreal‚Äô Office. Anyone had any experience with it? Horror stories?</p>

<p>As for graphics, I‚Äôd like something okay but not a bank-breaker. I don‚Äôt need some super-mongo overclocked beast. Comparing my gaming needs (about year-old games, max - Doom 3, Quake 4, Brothers in Arms/CoD2/MoH-PA/etc.) and price I‚Äôm thinking mostly about an nVidia GeForce 7900 or 7950, not sure which or which sub-line. I‚Äôve also got to get a new monitor - I want a 17‚Äù flatpanel, so size is limited there, but I‚Äôm still way under budget so I want a really nice, fast one, good for gaming as well as general use. Suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll be buying and building within a month, so I have to clean off my old PC fast - which means until then, I‚Äôll be mixing my ass off.</p>

<p>Wish me luck‚Ä¶</p>

<p><em>(Again, I‚Äôm happy for the time capsule of where I was with posts like this one. I‚Äôm still largely on the PC I ultimately built a month or so after this, though it‚Äôs on Windows 8 and I‚Äôve got an even better graphics card and sound card. My studio logs back up my timeline here - I kept wanting to say I was lazy, but looking over the posts of the past few months, again, from seven years later, I‚Äôm amazed I got as far as I did.</em></p>
