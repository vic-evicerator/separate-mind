I"´<p>So I got two songs finished for the <em>New World Blasphemy</em> split, released the split, and was rather pleased with how well the songs were received. I was also encouraged by the fact that I managed to knock out these two songs rather quickly, and so I thought I could convert the momentum and get â€œCrimson Frostâ€ finished.</p>

<p>This was also when the title came in. As I looked over all the black metal I had been listening to over the past couple of years, I noticed how itâ€™s never just â€˜redâ€™. Itâ€™s always â€˜Crimsonâ€™. It sounds more dramatic that way. I also liked how everyone did the weather report stuff about ice, snow, glaciers, etc. It became natural that, given my penchant for humorous titles, I would combine the two biggest cliches in black metal to create the title of the album - but it also worked on a more literal level, as Iâ€™d always intended to do at least one song about long-dead and frozen warriors, and them bleeding onto the snow where they died would be, literally, <em>Crimson Frost</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, I wavered back and forth over whether or not they would come back to life seeking revenge. And, again, that became a metaphor for what to do with this album, as I kept changing what I wanted.</p>

<p>Now, I donâ€™t know why. Back then, it was obvious. To more familiarize myself with black metal, I began visiting more and more black metal forums, listening to others speak about what they thought black metal â€˜was all aboutâ€™. My reasoning, at the time, was that if I was going to really touch on everything that black metal is, it would help to understand what that â€˜everythingâ€™ is, and one way to do that was to talk to many different people who listen to it - for study purposes.</p>

<p>Hopefully now you see where I went wrong. I didnâ€™t, at the time.</p>

<p>Okay, Iâ€™ll tell you. I listened to what OTHERS THOUGHT.</p>

<p>As I hope youâ€™ve noticed from reading my other writings on other songs, my main impetus and inspiration comes from myself - MY reactions, thoughts, and feelings on things are what create that spark that generates new songs for me. By listening to what others thought, and trying to incorporate that into my ideas, I was actually separating songwriting from my own thoughts, however subtle that separation might seem upon reading this.</p>

<p>But I didnâ€™t get this at the time. I just wanted desperately to write five or six more songs of â€˜black metalâ€™ that were kinda like â€œBlack Flamesâ€ and â€œRitual Curseâ€ and churn out the album.</p>

<p>And, remember, this is mid-2001, so I also had that â€œDoom-Metalâ€-album rock in my shoe. Whenever I was frustrated with <em>Crimson Frost</em> getting nowhere I would tinker with parts of â€œDoom Metalâ€, not wanting to be doing nothing but also feeling like any effort not spent on CF was a waste. I didnâ€™t want to do what I was doing, but couldnâ€™t do what I wanted.</p>

<p>After a couple of months of such wavering, I realized I was literally getting nowhere, and decided I had to either shit or get off the pot. From there, it was simple math - for â€œDoom Metalâ€ I had three finished songs and ideas for at least two more; for <em>Crimson Frost</em> I had nothing. So, dejectedly, I began finishing what would become <em>Monolith to an Abandoned Past</em> - though there was some shred of hope there, since once it was done ALL I would have to work on is <em>Crimson Frost</em>, and the statement of the album itself would show I was leaving the past behind and moving to a new future.</p>

<p>Though I should have known that bitch Fate would have different plans for me than I didâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(Looking back now, I donâ€™t know why I was so dead-set on doing some black metal that was in that newer vein. I did find the major works inspiring, but that same thing holds true for lots of inspiring works I listen to from other metal sub-genres - I get just as much of a kick out of Kill â€˜em All or Bonded by Blood or Leprosy as I do out of Vampires of Black Imperial Blood or Blut und Krieg. Was it just that I had many online friends and circles who were into this and I wanted to do something that catered to them? Did I not see how many of the hardcore-black-metallers were also into other metal styles, though many would die before admit it in public? Did I just want it because I told myself for so long that I wanted it? Did I just want to earn my place on â€œThe Black Metal Listâ€ that floated around Usenet all those years ago?)</em></p>
