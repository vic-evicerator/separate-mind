I"Ã<p>LiveJournal recently added Tags, which I think are a much better way for me to keep track of related/serial posts than the old, cumbersome Memories function. Iâ€™ve only just now gotten around to activating it, though.</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™ve tagged entries back to December 2005 and will finish up the rest soon. Iâ€™ve got tags for lyrics, band news, label news, and essays, and will ultimately get tags up for each album as well so you can view all the â€˜writing ofâ€™ and â€˜lyricsâ€™ posts together. If anyone else wants anything else tag-wise out of this blog, let me know.</p>

<p><em>(Itâ€™s not much of a post, but the fact that I mentioned this feature at all shows that my mindset now isnâ€™t that far off from my mindset then - being organized and making it easier to find the right thing is always worthwhile.</em></p>

<p><em>Not that I always wisely use the time I save. I guess thereâ€™s a bit too much of David Lamb in me.)</em></p>
