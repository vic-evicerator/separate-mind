I"Ó<p>Too often people forget about those pesky New Yearâ€™s Resolutions by MLK day (thatâ€™s January 15 or so for non-US peopleâ€¦). I put my resolutions down in an earlier blog post since they mostly related to me and my musical activities and because I expected to be held to them.</p>

<p>Well, Iâ€™m pleased to say that the newsletter thing is going well. Weâ€™ve had two out already (one monthly, always on the 13th), and we have features planned for the next one. ADR has just signed a new band and the details will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>ADR also managed to get the new Vrolok albums out, which has been keeping me busy lately. However, that has cut into my work time on other musical fronts. Namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I WILL begin working on both Dauder Sofa AND <em>Letters From Hell</em>. I will have at least one song for each done by the end of February.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I dropped the ball on this one. I have nothing. So, let me have it.</p>

<p><em>(Funny how even back then I was trying to use the blog as accountability/a spur to get my own stuff done. Again, as I noted in my previous entryâ€™s comments, I WAS getting a lot done - just not in my own music. Maybe thatâ€™s where the rust set inâ€¦)</em></p>
