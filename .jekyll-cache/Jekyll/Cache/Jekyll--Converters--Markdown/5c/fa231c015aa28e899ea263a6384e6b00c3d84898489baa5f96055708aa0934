I"·<p>Itâ€™s new, but itâ€™s old. Since they charge you to change names, I though I would just start a new LiveJournal for my music blog. The tagging and calendar-post-history features are too good for me to pass up, so while Blogger does a few things better, this is really mostly what I want my blog to look like.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be migrating my selected posting history here soon, and perhaps writing new posts about old events.</p>

<p>And, hopefully, new posts about new events.</p>

<p>Edited 2014-09-18 to add: This July 17 post is actually the first post on this blog. Everything before this date is history, migrated from one of my many other former, disparate blog homes. If youâ€™ve followed me for some time, of course, you know already that thatâ€™s just the way I do things - I like to dwell on my past, and I like pinning down the details - dates, names, times, etc.</p>

<p>And if youâ€™re new here, well, now you know it too.</p>
