I"…<p>Migrating my posts from my old livejournal to this one by hand has been a very positive experience for me - reliving in semi-sorta-real-time the past helps me rebuild my memories of the past decade, giving me a time-trip back to where I was back then and helping put the today-me into a greater context for self-understanding.</p>

<p>Or, without all the armchair psychobabble, it helps me see where I was, and the difference between there-then and here-now is enlightening.</p>

<p>But, itâ€™s a slow process. As I write this now, nine days after starting, Iâ€™m only up through the tail-end of 2005. Itâ€™s mostly downhill from there, because I didnâ€™t blog anywhere near as much in 2006/07/08 as I did in 04-05. But Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll get into that.</p>

<p>Once thatâ€™s done, Iâ€™ll probably be doing more reflective posts as I labor on bringing my websites up to date and working on my drum programs. I have so many good kit sounds that building a kit means making choices I donâ€™t want to make. They ALL sound good. Still, I recognize this as a hurdle I MUST clear, and the reasons why will make good blog-fodder for the near future as well.</p>
