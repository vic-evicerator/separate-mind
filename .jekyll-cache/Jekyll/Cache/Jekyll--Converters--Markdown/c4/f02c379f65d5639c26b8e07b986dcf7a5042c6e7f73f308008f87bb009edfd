<p>Breath of the Dragon #3 is out now. Good interview with ADRâ€™s newest signees, Midwynter. Weâ€™ve also overhauled the ADR website so it looks much better now - or at least more unified with the webstore. Also some UHR tidbits in there.</p>

<p>And now that means I can get some real UHR work done. Thatâ€™s next on the plate. That and demolishing the christian â€˜metalâ€™ fantasies of poseurs.</p>

<p><em>(I must have just sent BotD #3 out about an hour before posting this, judging from the time stamp. I still remember getting the Midwynter demo in my PO Box that month and being blown away. The Vrolok discs were still warm from the presses, but we didnâ€™t have any idea of what to do next. Normally that wouldnâ€™t worry me so much, except that even here, less than a year before we would call it quits, we were still in an expansionist mindset. I guess also that business was booming, because I donâ€™t remember money being an issue with getting the Midwynter released - it was more a matter of having something to put out.</em></p>
