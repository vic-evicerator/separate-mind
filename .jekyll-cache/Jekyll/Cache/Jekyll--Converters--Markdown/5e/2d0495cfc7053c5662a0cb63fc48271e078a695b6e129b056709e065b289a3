<blockquote>
  <p>In professional wrestling, <strong>kayfabe</strong> is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as â€œrealâ€ or â€œtrue,â€ specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this â€œrealityâ€ within the realm of the general public.</p>

<p>When I was a kid I spent every Monday night from 8-10 PM glued to the USA Network, watching Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby â€œThe Brainâ€ Heenan trade verbal barbs and comment over hours and hours of athletic showmanship. â€œFakeâ€ in the sense that nobody was really beating the crap out of each other and the guys were all good friends or at least cordial co-workers, but you really canâ€™t fake being a 200+ pound guy who can jump six feet into the air, turn horizontally, and perfectly time a kick to what looks like a guyâ€™s face without actually hurting him, or yourself. The outlandish costumes, the stage/ring names, rivalries and alliances, gimmicks like cage matches or special events like Battle Royalesâ€¦</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really no wonder I got into the 90â€™s-era resurgence of Black Metal. Whatâ€™s really the wonder is that I never made this connection before. Itâ€™s all kayfabe.</p>

<p>Hell, even before I delved into the Norse resurgence and the crude, lo-fi underground, way back in high school when I was still a fan of professional wrestling, I also became a big fan of Venom. The completely outlandish covers, over-the-top song titles and lyrics, and most of all the sinister stage names they took, was something I took to immediately. Even on the very first â€˜Rampage demoâ€™, which is really just a boombox in the corner of my bedroom capturing me, Paul, and Ben jamming and making up songs on the spot, we adopted pseudonyms. Granted, â€œCrakk Smakkâ€ isnâ€™t exactly in the same ballpark (or hemisphere) as â€œCronosâ€ when it comes to the Coolness-of-Pseudonym scale, but it did clearly announce my aspirations - I wanted whatever I did with music to have a bit more to it than just music. After all, if it were just Terry Bollea and Andre Roussimoff doing some elaborately-arranged fight choreography in front of 93,000+ fans, even if it were exactly the same moves, culminating in a 310-pound guy picking up a 500+ pound guy for a bodyslam, it just doesnâ€™t have as much of a dramatic impact as it does when you add in the characters â€œHulk Hoganâ€, â€œAndre the Giantâ€, and the big months-long feud that led up to said bodyslam. That context, even if itâ€™s fictional, is what gives you the emotional hook into the story, or song, or whatever it is that is being contextualized by the kayfabe.</p>

<p>My time in my first bands was more serious, and we really didnâ€™t present anything other than the minimal â€˜metalâ€™ look - long hair, dark clothes, band logo t-shirts and such, and edgy-looking instruments. However, in both Early Warning and in Skiptoe, we had our fuck-around bands - you know, where everyone switches to everyone elseâ€™s instruments and you rip out pisstake covers or the occasional joke-laden original song just for fun. Well, in those bands, we did do a bit more of the kayfabe routine, complete with fake band names and stage names. If youâ€™ve read my song history you know that a few of the songs and lyrics from early Rampage releases go back to â€œSlaughterhouseâ€, the fuck-around band for Skiptoe in 1995-1996, but my own monicker â€œVicâ€, originally â€œMC Vicâ€, goes back to 1991 when Early Warning, during our second or third practice, formed â€œThe Guys Who Wear Black Too Muchâ€. It was only natural that I would carry the kayfabe idea forward when I put together Rampage again in 1996.</p>

<p>Reinforcing this was a particular partner in crime, Jason Christie of Gortician. He was one of the first guys I met in online metal newsgroups, and seeing the outlandish tales of Bob Arctor, Timothy Archer, and the eternally-revolving list of JCâ€™s screen-names (â€œDavid Lee Abazagorothâ€ is the only one I remember, but they were all funny mash-ups like that) inspired me to ramp-up the fiction around Rampage I was building - going so far as to solicit pictures and even thanks lists from various other online friends I asked to use as â€˜Band Membersâ€™. I saw precedent in other bands, from Bathoryâ€™s more fanciful tales to the deliberate exaggerations of Mayhem to the fanciful imaginations of Immortal to the outright real-life acting-out of unsavory things by Burzum, Dissection, and others. The mode and forms were completely different, but the method and effect were the same - by deliberately creating a context for the music by other not-specifically-musical acts, you can heighten the impact of the music you create. It becomes much more of an experience to immerse yourself into, a shield or wall you build to isolate everything else outside, so that you can focus more intensely on the fictional narrative you are witnessing.</p>

<p>I used to be elaborately and obsessively protective about maintaining the kayfabe of my bands and of Unsung Heroes Records, which is strange considering I was also set on making the various narratives so outlandish that you were supposed to know it was all bullshit anyway. Itâ€™s like I wanted everyone to really believe that Lance Boyle was some strung-out basspounder with a disgusting bent to his music, but I also wanted kudos for creating such a reprobate. And most everyone who follows anything I do knows itâ€™s all bullshit anyway - so why keep it up? I guess for the same reason that WWE is still a thing - for those who like it, itâ€™s fun.</p>

<p>Which is all just a really long preface to the mention that I finally found the original version of that old â€œCancer of the Psuedonymâ€ post, as well as the post with my pseudonymous obituaries, in which I first came clean about all of this stuff a few years ago. Iâ€™ll get them both reposted soon, perhaps with some extra commentary about the hows and whys of my virtual metal musician menagerie. Just remember, while they all had terminal cancer, theyâ€™re all kinda still alive, and maybe even working.</p>

<p>No, really, I amâ€¦ I mean, â€˜We Areâ€™. *wink*</p>
