I"®<p>Or almost, anyway. EVERYTHING FOR <em>BELLUM AETERNUM</em> IS RECORDED!</p>

<p>Not that the entire album is finished, of course. To save the maximum time for recording I put off a lot of the recording-process cleanup work, like cleaning up the splices, trimming out noise, deciding on multiple takes, that sort of thing. Since editing can be done piecemeal, it can be done in-between rugrat play sessions, midnight feedings, during napsâ€¦ so it will be a while before even Aerik can get his hands on it, much less any of you can hear it.</p>

<p>But my goal, to have the recording finished before little Vic #2 gets here, has been met.</p>

<p>And while my recording tales are nothing like the drinking/carousing/bar fights/bitchfests with the producer/label idiots tales that many more populous bands can tell, I did make mental (and pencil) note of a few things that I will eventually share that may be of some interest to the budding home/DIY musician.</p>

<p><em>(Ah, such naive words - little did I know that within four weeks the PC this was on would blow up and all of these recordings would be in jeopardy of permanent death.</em></p>

<p><em>At least I had a plan.)</em></p>
