I"‘<p>Just to let you all know that I AM staying current, but that there just isnâ€™t much going on.</p>

<p>I still havenâ€™t got my PC totally rebuilt, so I havenâ€™t been able to see if I can salvage the earlier-recorded <em>Bellum</em> sessions. I just bought a much-needed DVD burner for that PC, so I have to open it up soon anyway, thus I will have the perfect â€˜excuseâ€™ to get this done soon.</p>

<p>Not that it matters too much - Aerik has told me that nothing new will come out from his end of things until October.</p>

<p>Still, heâ€™s sitting on three things right now, with a fourth probably in his hands by then.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still playing with my strat, learning old Dire Straits licks and songs, and just getting used to a different sound and style of playing. This will come to fruition when I start writing the Dauder Sofa material in earnest.</p>

<p>And, donâ€™t worry, I havenâ€™t forgotten about Death Beast or <em>Letters from Hell</em>â€¦</p>

<p>But, for now, all is quiet on the Rampage front.</p>

<p><em>â€œDauder Sofaâ€. â€œLetters From Hellâ€. So many dead-ends of roads that could have gone places. Maybe somedayâ€¦</em></p>
