I" <p>12 days?!?! How do I let these go on so long without updates?</p>

<p>Oh yeah - too many bands, labels, work projects, and mountains of bullshit.</p>

<p>But I swear it was just yesterday that I said I was taking a break. Oh well, I needed it.</p>

<p>And Iâ€™m back on my game now. I love Dell laptops.</p>

<p><em>(Almost not worth posting if you look at the content itself. But consider the context - When I routinely now go months to years between blog posts, itâ€™s refreshing to see the naivete in thinking I owe people an explanation for just under two weeks of silence. I guess diligence is just not putting up with your own bullshit excuses.)</em></p>
