I"}<p>This was another one that started out life as a Slaughterhouse song. Since we were grind, many of our songs were either blurs of unknown fretted low-string notes picked really fast or blasts of open low strings picked really fast, with one occasional slow riff worked in to keep shit honest. We made most of the songs about hating bitches, since I had had girl problems in the past and Brian was going through them at the time. Mostly we’d just scream indecipherably. But one time I wanted to write real lyrics. One song, randomly given the name “Dead Rot”, had a really neat chorus riff - total mosh-type speed, midpaced headbanger. It’s what is currently the chorus riff of the song. I just thought of the cadence of the riff and came up with the chorus as you hear it now.</p>

<p>Well, at the time I was on a Carcass kick, so I thought that I should write an insult-kill-you-bitch song in that particularly wordy style they have, and since I didn’t have to worry about the riff (it was just open-e blasting), I just wrote out some shit, then used the most laborious synonyms I could think of:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You are a cunt of the copulation persuasion
Your existence and endless search for pointless breedings
Countless encounters with prophylactically protected penile protrusions
None of which are possessed by me
You fucking whore

You gave me a world of pain
You gave me a broken heart
I would love to see you dead
I would love to see you rot
Dead
Rot
Dead
Rot
DEADROT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s also where I got the idea to tie the words together. I don’t know why. Somehow, “DeadRot” looks a bit cooler than “Dead Rot”. Anyway, after that point, I wanted a midpaced breakdown, and at the time had been working on guitar chops by learning guitar tab from the Metallica “Justice…” songbook. And I always loved that part in “Blackened” where it’s just slow crunching on the E’s and they have verses that are all just single words that end in ‘-tion’. And then I remembered that Sepultura had a song like that. Then, I figured, since it’s a ‘trend’ now, I might as well make my own contribution:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Masturbation
Fornication
Stimulation
No Procreation

Masturbation
Fornication
Stimulation
No Procreation
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then modulate up a half-step and do another one:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Copulation
Cocks invadin'
All the way in
I'll kick your face in

Copulation
Cocks invadin'
All the way in
I'll kick your face in
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, of course, blast out the ending superfast with crazy solos and shit. I think Slaughterhouse played this song in this form once. It didn’t totally take shape until that first time Paul and I recorded, which is where I added that slow, doomy intro guitar thing and tacked a chorus onto the end with the super-fucked-up scream. Paul loved it.</p>

<p>When it came time to record the song for the <em>Misogyny</em> EP, I didn’t really change too much. I put a big flange effect on the intro and structured the ‘solo’ part enough to put a harmony with it.</p>

<p><em>(Another song that should probably be issued with a trigger warning. It’s another one that’s structured a little more unusually compared to most of my songs, which is probably why I like it. It didn’t really benefit as much from the rerecording in 2006 as the others on this EP did - not sure why.)</em></p>
