I"€<p>In all the hubbub, I canâ€™t believe I almost forgot this.</p>

<p>Ujval Singh Sidhu-Brar of <a href="http://www.metalcrypt.com/">The Metal Crypt</a> has just posted an extensive interview with me about, well, pretty much every musical thing Iâ€™ve got my finger in. He even dug deep, asking me about history like my Early Warning and Skiptoe days, my favorite band Disjecta Membra (the greatest band youâ€™ve never heard), and even digging up stuff like the Kaoteon affair. He even gets to the hardhitting questions about songwriting, major versus minor labels, and whatâ€™s wrong with NSBM.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=199">go check it out</a>.</p>

<p><em>(This interview was a ton of fun, and Iâ€™m still happy with almost everything I said in it and can stand behind it 100% even now, seven years later. Good on ya, Cluedo.)</em></p>
