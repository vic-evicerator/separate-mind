I"¯<p>Yep, Iâ€™ve finally completed yet another transmigration. Now that this blog is fully implemented on the 000-webhost site, Iâ€™ve also finished going through the whole blog and updating all of the categories and tags. There are still some wrong links and missing images and Iâ€™ll have to figure that stuff out - combined with deciding whether to go with an old web-style image hosting or go with one of the things the kids are using nowadays - Imgur, Instagram, Flickr - what ARE they using nowadays?</p>

<p>And to avoid the risk of this being all about housekeeping, Iâ€™ve also got a monster post in the works that will likely get broken up - a â€œThen and Nowâ€ kind of thing, actually. October 2018 may well see the release of Death Beast <em>The Onslaught</em>, which is actually a nice bit of serendipity since it is also the 20th anniversary of the release of my first proper solo full-length album, Rampageâ€™s first full length <em>This End Up</em>. Iâ€™ve done a deep dive into that album already, song by song, and Iâ€™ve been working on those for Death Beast (and Festering Sore) as well, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever really addressed at length the whole recording process. Those are special times in my life, even though they didnâ€™t really seem like it at the time. Chuck Schuldiner was more right than he knew with the song â€œSymbolicâ€â€¦</p>

<p>So, hopefully, more to come soon, and not just meta-bullshitting like this.</p>
