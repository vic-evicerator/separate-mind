I"¯<p>Things are great, mostly, but with a few shitty things. Our new son was born last week. Despite the thread title, he‚Äôs actually letting us get a somewhat decent amount of rest, so I actually have time to make progress on all of the non-Rampage musical work I had set myself to do over the next couple of months.</p>

<p>But my fucking computer is dead. My main home desktop, that is. Thankfully my laptop is okay (DAMN, I said it‚Ä¶ oops‚Ä¶.), but a lot of my work is stymied until I can figure out WHAT is going on and fix it.</p>

<p>To a few people I‚Äôm doing business with for UHR and ADR - I owe some of you e-mails. You will get them shortly. And Commander Keen - I have your FTP info set up, so hopefully we can get the Demontage show on the road real fuckin‚Äô soon - this album SHREDS!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and an almost-belated HAPPY NATIONAL DAY OF REASON:</p>

<p><em>(I‚Äôll have to doublecheck my history timelines, but I think this was when I was preparing to release the first Demontage album, ‚ÄúSacrilege ‚Äòn‚Äô Miscreancy‚Äù on UHR. I think I released the Black Torment album ‚ÄúObscurum II‚Äù at the same time. Interesting that I could still keep things going, even with a dead desktop.)</em></p>
