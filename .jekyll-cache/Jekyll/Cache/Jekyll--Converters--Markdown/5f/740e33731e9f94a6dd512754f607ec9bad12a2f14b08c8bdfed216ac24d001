I"Ê<p>‚Ä¶ and vacation is exactly where I‚Äôm headed for the next week. But since I‚Äôve had one of my regular long silences, I figure I owe an update as well.</p>

<p>I know you‚Äôre tired of seeing me say ‚ÄúBellum is almost done‚Äù, but it really is. It‚Äôs like this - I have drum programming tweaks to three songs that are completed on my laptop that need to be imported into the studio PC. Then I have three or four songs that the bass is buried because of EQ issues, and I need to tweak those. Then, there are overall minor ‚Äòspit-n-polish‚Äô details - the effect on this solo, the clean guitar there is too low, that kind of shit. It‚Äôs the nitty-gritty, I‚Äôm-99%-there-and-the-last-1%-takes-forever frustrating time. But it‚Äôs SOOOO damn close to perfect. You guys will be really happy to see how big an improvement this is over the old version - and not just in the vocals.</p>

<p>The Death Beast demo compilation I mentioned before is compiled, and inserts are being printed as we speak. I need to master the disc and that will be ready, soon after vacation. It will be released concurrently with the Chemikiller/Rampage split Venom tribute (which ALSO has a damn killer booklet. This pro-CDR thing is GREAT!).</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I saw the Antichrist Vanguard tour when they stopped here in Atlanta - Gravewurm, Nachtmystium, Negative Plane, Angelcorpse, and Watain. All the bands kicked ass, I got a CD and some free swag from Funeral of Gravewurm, and I also got pics of all the bands. I‚Äôll be posting those shortly. In addition, I decided that for the next Breath of the Dragon newsletter I will interview Funeral about the goings-on of the tour. So often people think the underground is all internet and local shows, so something like this is a good way to show people that it may be smaller, but it‚Äôs just as viable as ‚Äòthe mainstream‚Äô - and damn more fun, heavy, and evil.</p>

<p>And with this post, the last thing gets crossed off my ‚Äòto-do‚Äô list, and I can vacation in fun, sun, and beer for a whole week. Seeya later‚Ä¶</p>
