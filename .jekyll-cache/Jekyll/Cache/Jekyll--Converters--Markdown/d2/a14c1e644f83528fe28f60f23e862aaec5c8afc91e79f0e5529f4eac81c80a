I"•<p>Pink eye sucks. At least I didn‚Äôt get it before the Priest show. Which, by the way, I have NOT forgotten about (how could I!?)‚Ä¶ expect a blog/show review of it sometime soon.</p>

<p>My Bahamas cruise is only 2 weeks away. I‚Äôm fukkin‚Äô psyched. This weekend is the first live show for Nox Invictus, Toby‚Äôs other main band. Unfortunately I‚Äôll be visiting my folks during the July 4 weekend, so I won‚Äôt be able to make it. Hopefully he‚Äôll dig up a video camera.</p>

<p>Word on the street is that Ramrod finally knocked out that Chemikiller album <em>Evilspeak</em>. I can‚Äôt wait for that. I feel kinda guilty after saying I would record bass for it and then being forced not to - even if the ‚Äòforce‚Äô was a bunch of uncooperative PCs. At least it didn‚Äôt set him back except time-wise. It would have been a major crime for that album to not come out.</p>

<p>And now, the trustbusting:</p>

<p>I love wireless networking. Imagine chilling out downstairs, curled up on the sofa with the laptop, scouring the web for all manner of information and goodies. ‚ÄúLook ma, no wires!‚Äù However, the pitfall is of course wireless security. As it turns out, most of what they tell you to do is useless as hackers know how to defeat most wireless security measures quite easily.</p>

<p>*Disable SSID? - they‚Äôve got network scanners 
*MAC Filtering? - watch for broadcasts, then spoof the MAC address 
*WEP Encryption? - Don‚Äôt make me laugh. Can be broken by skriptkiddies in about 30 seconds</p>

<p>Fortunately, WPA encryption seems to be very secure and reliable, but is also so new that most older equipment won‚Äôt support it - and, even if you get all new equipment, most older OS‚Äôs don‚Äôt support it. Even if your client software for your wireless card says it allows you to use WPA, if you‚Äôre using anything but Windows XP it won‚Äôt actually use it. All the support documentation for the various major wireless manufacturers out there say the same thing: if you‚Äôre on Win 98/ME/2000, you need a third-party client that will enable WPA support, ‚Äúsuch as Funk Software‚Äôs Odyssey client‚Äù. Go to their support forums/knowledge bases, etc., and everyone from Linksys to D-Link to Netgear and beyond all say the same thing - get Funk Odyssey.</p>

<p>Well, I checked it out - you get free 30 days, then have to pay $50 for the client license. There‚Äôs GOT to be some sort of collusion/pricefixing/kickbacks that all of these cocksuckers out there are onto. And don‚Äôt bother the sharewarez networks - the only serials out there are for 3.0.3 but Funk just upgraded Odyssey to 4.0.</p>

<p>BUT - we have other options.</p>

<p>http://www.download.com/ is a great, great place for all sorts of software, but it suffers, much like the web itself, from the very thing that makes it great - it‚Äôs too fucking big with too much shit on it. Vague searches turn up way too many things to be useful and you have to wade through a lot of crap, but more targeted searches are impossible if you have very narrow requirements but no actual exact keywords to search for.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, someone else has blazed the trail.</p>

<p>So, if you‚Äôre on a Windows 2000 machine and want secure WPA support for your wireless network, and don‚Äôt want to get assraped for $50, LucidLink Client 2.2 is exactly what you need:</p>

<p>http://www.download.com/LucidLink-Wireless-Client/3000-2155_4-10381499.html</p>

<p>Completely free, fairly easy to configure, and secure. Sorry all you 98/ME people‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm sure something else will turn up.</p>

<p><em>(The links aren‚Äôt dead, for a change. It‚Äôs weird hearing me go super-in-depth to solve a problem that will almost never happen anymore. It‚Äôs kinda like hearing someone describe what you have to do now to hitch your horses to your wagon when it‚Äôs cold outside - technology has moved so far beyond that point that you‚Äôre almost speaking another language. Progress=good.</em></p>

<p><em>Also neat to see the offhand reference to Chemikiller‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvilspeak‚Äù album. I still rock that one on occasion, and while I knew of a time before it existed, it‚Äôs neat to see old, concrete reminders like this. Well, digital concrete, but you know what I mean.)</em></p>
