I"N<p>Nothing to report here. I’m doodling on guitar for a few projects, but nothing’s quite coming together and nothing is recorded.</p>

<p>On a plus note, Alpha Draconis Records’ latest release, the debut EP from Midwynter, “Four Seasons of Frost”, is at the plant and should be back any day now.</p>

<p><em>(It may not seem like it from the brevity of the post above, but this was important. We had only just heard of Midwynter a month or two before, so this just goes to show how fast we moved on that one. But, as I keep saying, business was good back then.)</em></p>
