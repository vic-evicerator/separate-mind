I"Ü<p>Sorry for the long delay, but after a year of hand-conversion and learning to program in an entirely new environment, my personal website and blog are now back online. Anyone familiar with my history usually notes that I make big announcements for small changes, tease â€˜more info soonâ€™, then drag my feet delivering. Iâ€™ll try to break that cycle now.</p>

<p>For the moment, this is more a proof of concept, since using Jekyll to build my site/blog is new to me, and some of the funcionality I can only test as itâ€™s live, so if this works, then things really SHOULD go more quickly.</p>

<p>But then, we all know what a shitshow 2020 has been, which is when this whole thing first fell apart, just before the whole fucking world did as well. And thatâ€™s a story Iâ€™m actually eager to tell, as well as catch you up on what a whole year of pandemic has done to the least-hard-working-man in show business.</p>

<p>But for now, just cross your fingers and hope this works.</p>
