I"Â<p>We finally have the Midwynter stuff back from the plant. Technically itâ€™s out now, but we still have to update the site, integrate it into the webstore and catalog, send out trade offers, etc.</p>

<p>Whet your appetite by listening to two songs from the EP here:</p>

<p>More on my own projects laterâ€¦</p>

<p><em>(Again, this post is short but it still underscores just how fast we were moving back then. Unlike many of the links in these old posts, though, this one is still active, and it takes you to their myspace where they have this entire EP we released online as well as tracks from a later release. Check them out.)</em></p>
