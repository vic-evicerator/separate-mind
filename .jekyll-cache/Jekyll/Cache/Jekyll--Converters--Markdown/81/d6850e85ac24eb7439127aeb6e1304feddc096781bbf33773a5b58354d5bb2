I"4<p>I started recording the Rampage material that I had written between 1993 and 1998 in January 1998. By that time I had been into this newer wave of black metal for a few years, picked up most of the bigger-name classics (<em>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</em>, <em>Transilvanian Hunger</em>, <em>Pure Holocaust</em>, <em>Vampires of Black Imperial Blood</em>, etc.), and decided I wanted to try moving in this direction. Since I had three and a half albums of songs backlogged already, I thought I would just bash out what I had quickly while I spent time writing and thinking up ideas for this newer black metal stuff. By Halloween 1998 I had knocked out the first <em>Misogyny EP</em> and <em>This End Up</em>, and started work on <em>Doom Metal</em>. In my series on the <em>Doom Metal</em> album and what would become <em>Monolith to an Abandoned Past</em>, I talked about how I finished that first song (the song ‚ÄúDoom Metal‚Äù), heard the improvements I‚Äôd made in production and sound techniques, and decided I wanted to do <em>Bellum Infinitum</em> instead. There were a couple of smaller factors here that played into it all. First, I was impatient - I wanted all my old stuff done so I could get to the new black metal stuff. Second, <em>Bellum</em> was a completely finished album, while I still had two or three songs to write for <em>Doom Metal</em>. Third, I was getting into some of the more epic side of black metal then (Graveland, most notably), and while the styles are different, the mindset and mood of <em>Bellum</em> is closer to this type of black metal than the <em>Doom Metal</em> stuff is.</p>

<p>To help assuage my impatience, I knocked out that Immortal cover in an afternoon, then started working on <em>Bellum</em>. Also in there was that Darkthrone track for the Destr0y Productions tribute, so that helped as well. But once <em>Bellum</em> was out the door, it got worse.</p>

<p>I had agreed to that split tribute to Hellhammer, but most of 2000 was me wasting time trying to write black metal and getting mostly nowhere, trying to finish the <em>Doom Metal</em> stuff and getting nowhere, and pushing UHR and Bloody Leg Studios out of sheer frustration. While my other activities got far ahead in 2000, Rampage didn‚Äôt do much of anything.</p>

<p>So, by the beginning of 2001, I was adamant about changing that. To that end, I started seeking out more black metal bands to get on UHR, and maybe work out some kind of split, thinking that would encourage me to get stuff written. I met the guys from Enbilulugugal, Chernobog, Cross Sodomy, Black Torment, and a few other USBM bands, and eventually got the <em>New World Blasphemy</em> split worked out between Cross Sodomy, Song of Melkor, and Rampage.</p>

<p>I was just moving from one house to another in December 2000, and the last thing I did in the old house was the recording for the Hellhammer tribute. In 2001, once in the new house, I upgraded my computer, and then found I had to upgrade my soundcard and software, and in the playing around while waiting for those shipments was when I stumbled across the song pieces that would form the two songs Rampage recorded for <em>New World Blasphemy</em>. I‚Äôll tackle each song individually in separate entries, though both were basically written and recorded concurrently in March-April of 2001.</p>

<p><em>(Also not mentioned above, for the summer after finishing Bellum Infinitum, I spent several months doing preproduction and then recording and production of the Festering Sore album. I really need to integrate this part of my past into the greater history. Someday.)</em></p>
