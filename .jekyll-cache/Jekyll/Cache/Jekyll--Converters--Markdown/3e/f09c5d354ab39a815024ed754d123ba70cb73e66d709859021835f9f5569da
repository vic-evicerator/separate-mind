I"è<p>Happy belated birthday to <em>Monolith to an Abandoned Past</em>, which turned four yesterday.</p>

<p>What is it about this time of year that sparks the creativity in me? Does anyone else get that urge to create when the leaves start changing and temperatures cool? Nights get longer, days get shorter, itâ€™s colder and everything is dying, but I get idea after idea. <em>This End Up</em>, <em>Bellum Infinitum</em>, <em>Monolithâ€¦</em>, all unleashed during those times. Even though a lot of the drudgery of takes and retakes may have happened over the summer or early fall, itâ€™s only towards the end of the albumâ€™s life cycle when EQ and mixing takes over from â€˜did I get that part rightâ€¦â€™. Odd. Iâ€™ll have to ponder this someday.</p>

<p><em>(Heh - in reposting this history, I mused about this just a few days ago on a post about a month before this one, and here I am musing on it again, or before. This time thing is messing me up more than a Doctor Who episode. Anyway, whatâ€™s interesting here is that I look at it here from the endpoint, the finished product and where I was at the end of the road. The more that Iâ€™ve thought about this subject, though, itâ€™s in the creative period, the spark and work that turn ideas into new songs and sounds, that the real answers to the mystery lie, and those happen in the spring, when days get longer and brighter and you feel rebirth and new possibilities.</em></p>

<p><em>Iâ€™ve still got some thinking to do about this.)</em></p>
