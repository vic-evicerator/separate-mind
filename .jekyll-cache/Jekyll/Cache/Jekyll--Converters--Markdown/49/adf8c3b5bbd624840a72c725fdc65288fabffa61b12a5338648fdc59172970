Terry “good soup” Schiavo - croaked 
The Pope (on the end of a rope) - croaked 
Mitch Hedburg (who I probably misspelled) - croaked</p>

<p>On the PLUS side, though:</p>

<p>Check up for news on the upcoming, very imminent release of the MISANTROPICAL PAINFOREST album <em>Winds Saturate With Inhumane Longing</em>.</p>

<p>I also took a trip with Toby to the music store this weekend - I came out one bass lighter and $100 richer, so I finally have room and cash for that new Strat I’ve been wanting for quite a while now. Toby came out with a lightly used Line 6 head (Can’t remember the model number now). He also finally heard the first test mix of the Death Beast album. His comment - “This fucking rules”. Or something similar. If not for this damn hour-loss thanks to DST this would’ve been a great past week and a half.</p>

<p>Also, keep your eyes on the UHR page for a few new announcements I’ve been waiting to make. Now that everything is cemented, I can make them - once I find time. Anybody know where I can pick up an extra hour or two? :(</p>

<p><em>(Another one of those snapshot-style dead links, though I could repost the ADR site if I wanted to - I still have the files.</em></p>

<p><em>I still think it was weird that so many things were happening in ‘the real world’ all at once. I still remember all the fuming over the Schiavo case.</em></p>

<p><em>And I guess this answers the question from the last post of what I was so busy about - it was both mixing Death Beast and working out the details for releasing the first Misantropical Painforest album. Even a decade later, I can still say this is one of the albums I’m most proud of having a hand in releasing. It’s been far too long since I’ve talked to Kutcheck - I should make an effort to reconnect. Because, if the list at the top of this post can tell us anything besides the fact that I like bad jokes, it’s that Time and Fate can be real bitches about taking the last chance you thought you had to do something.)</em></p>
