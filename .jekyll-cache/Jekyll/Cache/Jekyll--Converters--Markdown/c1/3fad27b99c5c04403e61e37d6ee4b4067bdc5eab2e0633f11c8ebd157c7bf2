I"‰<p>No, not meme-tagging. I finally finished tagging all of the entries in this journal. Now you can search through the blog for all my posts about band news, about a specific album, all my lyrics posts, etc. The full list of tags is below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>band</li>
  <li>history</li>
  <li>band news</li>
  <li>bellum aeternum</li>
  <li>bellum infinitum</li>
  <li>crimson frost</li>
  <li>essays</li>
  <li>label</li>
  <li>news</li>
  <li>misogyny</li>
  <li>misogyny 2</li>
  <li>monolith</li>
  <li>song lyrics</li>
  <li>this end up</li>
</ul>

<p>(Yes, it forces them all to lower case. Blech.)</p>

<p>Anyway, go have fun and re-learn something you thought you forgot about us.</p>

<p><em>(This needs some revisions, but itâ€™s still nice to see it laid out like this. Interesting, also, that a historical fix was faster back then. This took from 6/26 to 6/29, while these repostings have been going on now for about two months. In the notes on my last post I said it was gratifying to see Iâ€™m still in the same headspace. But it turns to chagrin when I see that the distractors are still sadly the same - but more time-consuming.)</em></p>
