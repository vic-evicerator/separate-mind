        <title>Lyrics - Drink 'til You Die</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After “Devastator”, it’s a bit of a toss-up as to which song was the second one written for &lt;em&gt;The Onslaught&lt;/em&gt; - either “You’re Fucking Doomed” or “Drink ‘til You Die”. I’m pretty sure I had the idea for the title of YFD first, as I directly lifted it from Stan Dementor when he told me he intended to title the second Wrath Ritual demo “You’re Fucking Doomed” back in 2004 or so. However, “Drink ‘til You Die” was certainly the second song finished, as it came from a very easy place to write - the a-string-based blues/thrash song. The style and the title came directly from “Blood of Dionysus” from the first album, which was exactly the same type of song, and I approached it from the position that I’d do one of these type of things on each album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I didn’t want to just rehash the same thing, so while it’s very similar I did try to distinguish each part so that it falls more on the ‘homage’ side of the line rather than ‘ripoff’. Instead of basing the riff on bluesy one-finger diads over a pedal tone I came up with a blues-rock-styled hammer-on riff that would work in between the pedal tones. It also helped that I had written a proper chorus instead of just going back and forth between the singing-verse riff and the other verse riff like the earlier song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the lyrics, these were by far the easiest lyrics to write. I took the same viewpoint of worshipping alcohol for the release it provides from daily agony and just wrote basically a love song to my favorite beer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Your golden brew flows like ice and fire in my veins
When I'm away from your touch it drives me insane
Quench the thirst that gnaws away at my mind
You're the only peace that I ever find

Drink it down - blood of the gods
Drink it deep - until I go blind
Drink it up - Dionysus adored
Drink to sacrifice - Drink 'til you die!

Oblivion, ecstasy, and bliss
You kill the hell of earth with your noxious kiss
Fuck their false heaven, it's right here in my glass
So drink up you worthless losers or kiss my ass

Drink it down - blood of the gods
Drink it deep - 'til I go blind
Drink it up - Dionysus adored
Drink to sacrifice - Drink 'til you die!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember much about writing them, so it must have been pretty quick and easy. It might have been at lunch, or at work, or in the shop waiting on the car to get fixed. Anyway, I knew I’d have to throw in another slow ‘blues’ solo, but I gave it a 16-bar turnaround rather than 12 and threw in a few more blues/rock-style guitar comps to make it feel different from the first song. I also thought I had the studio wherewithal to actually pull off other homages to my two favorite thrash-blues tracks by other bands - “Butt-Fuck” by Nuclear Assault and “Teacher’s Pet” by Venom. Beyond both having blues solos in the middle, I thought John Connelly’s rant in the middle of their song was funny, and I also had the bright idea to go ahead and put a lampshade on the fact that I just rehashed the same idea from the first album with my own rant - and, of course, I’d do the same “YOU FIGURE IT OUT!” on the lyrics sheet. As for Venom, I rewrote their ‘get your tits out’ singalong-screaming part to ‘get the taps out for the lads, and we’ll drink ‘em down!’, now that I had a plan for how to record it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew from the start that I’d get other friends of mine to do guest backing vocals, and I knew I’d have to give them scratch tracks and timing tracks, but I spent a night planning out the logistics of that middle section and then set it in motion. I recorded a couple of tracks of my own of the sing-song bit to get an idea of how long the pause should be, then I recorded two passes of my own screaming-and-hollering chaos to give the guys the idea of how to go about it and give them something to play off of. I was also careful to give a very distinctive drum fill which included the count back into the song so they knew when to quit. Overall I’m very happy with how it turned out - one of Toby’s improvised lines was so good I cut it from the middle and moved it to the very end of the song!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lyrics - Devastator</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Devastator” was the first song that I wrote for the new Death Beast album &lt;em&gt;The Onslaught&lt;/em&gt;. The song actually came together pretty quickly at first but the long cooking time led me to make a few changes that ultimately made it much stronger than the first draft. The original ‘demo’ mix of this song I had is dated to some time in 2007, so I’m pretty sure that I had other songs in various stages of work at the same time, but “Devastator” crystallized almost immediately as it came from a very direct, simple concept: “What if I turned Priest’s ‘Sinner’ into a thrash song?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to copy the song a-to-z, but three things about it struck me as things that would adapt easily to thrash - that steady, driving 8th-note rhythmic feel of the verses, the simplicity of the subtonic-tonic movement of the main riff, and the general lyrical story of a menacing, mysterious figure who’s come to bring not just harm but apocalyptic doom. The word ‘devastator’ had been in my head for a while, and so renaming the ‘sinner’ to the ‘devastator’ gave me a lyrical starting point. As for the music, the song’s main riff was just me taking ‘Sinner’ to 16th notes instead of 8th notes and adding in the flat 2 and the flat 5 (Eb and Ab, against D tonic) for the normal thrash musical accents. Moving the whole pattern up from the 1 to the 4 in the middle of the verse was another nod to &lt;em&gt;Sinner&lt;/em&gt;, though I also changed a bit of the way I played the chords to break the feel up a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-chorus/chorus part is where I broke from the source, using something that I thought could easily be a Metallica riff (simple minor/blues scale riff, heavy on the tritone) for the prechorus and then letting the chorus open up with ringing Ab chords and an interlude riff that mixed the major and minor thirds between repeats for a bit of a diminished sound before climbing up to Eb and wrapping it around back to the verse riff. On the demo version I let the guitars ring on an open D while the bass started the prechorus riff, but thinking in thrash terms I thought it needed more rhythmic punch so I had modified it by the live album to have the whole band stop except for one guitar grinding on the riff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another change from the demo to the live/studio versions was that bridge verse, which originally just had accent notes over a D pedal tone, but it felt too straight and so I started shifting bass notes on the repeat, then ultimately just changed the guitar riffs to mirror that, so that the whole verse took on that melodic contour (ugly as it is - D-&amp;gt;Ab-&amp;gt;A-&amp;gt;Bb-&amp;gt;the turnaround Eb-&amp;gt;C-&amp;gt;back to the 1). The climbing harmonies after that were something I’d done before, with Rampage’s “Wanderlust”, where I harmonize in one position then progressively skip the lower guitar up an octave per repeat until the crescendo. Then, just to keep it simple, I slammed out the solos over the prechorus/chorus riffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the lyrics, once I had the whole ‘menacing figure approaching’ vibe from “Sinner” in my mind, it was easy and fell together without a lot of coaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;With iron fist and steely glint
The Devastator rides
Destruction and mayhem on his mind
Death behind his eyes
A black sun falls, your time is short
Your death has now arrived
Cower or run, it matters not
Just kiss your ass goodbye

Death's fist, an iron grip
Choking out your life
The blood runs down your broken throat
And drowns your weakling cries
No time to run
No time to hide
Only time to die
Devastator

The landscape is littered with the bones
Of the fools who called him foe
Corpses broken, red blood waters
The seeds of death he's sown
Stench and plague, filth and rot
Harvest of brutality
The grinding heel comes crashing down
The last sight you'll ever see

Death's fist, an iron grip
Choking out your life
The blood runs down your broken throat
And drowns your weakling cries
No time to run
No time to hide
Only time to die
Devastator

Avatar of death
Herald of The Plague
You're all fucking doomed
There's no one to save you
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good deal of the imagery and direct lyrics from Sinner are pretty obviously cribbed (the black sun falling in verse 1, red blood watering seeds of death is a nod to both Sinner and The Sentinel), but there was a bit of a Baloff/Exodus nod too in the idea of choking a victim in his own blood. This method of paralleling or directly quoting lyrics and references to other bands’ songs would be expanded on later, though I didn’t know it at the time. Another theme I would expand on is at least making nodding reference to the entire concept of the album &lt;em&gt;The Onslaught&lt;/em&gt;. The song “Death Beast” on the first album referenced three names for the beast - the Death Beast, the Plague Beast, and the Hell Beast, which I imagined as a sort of Unholy Trinity. Since “Death Beast” was on the first album, I knew I’d have a song “Plague Beast” on this one, hence the reference to being Herald of The Plague. Also, even though I hadn’t written the song yet I did have the title for “You’re Fucking Doomed”, so the nod seemed to fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember finishing the demo version of this around 2007 and I know I shared it with Hartmuth and with a few other die-hard fans I knew from message boards and such. When the live album idea came around, doing a few songs from the upcoming album was a given and since this song was finished it was a shoe-in. The only other change bewteen the live version and the final album was a little rhythmic pause before the bridge. Metallica was always really good in their MoP/Justice days about doing interesting rhythmic modifications by adding just a single extra beat or note in the oddest places, and that extra ‘stutter’ before the bridge helped shift it from drive to overdrive, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It's Not Fake, It's Memorex</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that I always say it was 13 years between &lt;em&gt;The Wakening&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Onslaught&lt;/em&gt;, and that is a fact, but it’s not like there was absolutely nothing between those two. In fact, one of my favorite side-roads, creatively speaking, was taken in an attempt to bridge that gap - the infamous ‘fake’ live album by Death Beast, &lt;em&gt;Live Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;. And, true to many of my ideas for songs or albums over the years, it popped up in one of the most unlikely places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thread of the idea for the album came from the demos I had already been doing. In the couple of years after the release of &lt;em&gt;The Wakening&lt;/em&gt; I had rough demos of three songs - “Devastator”, which was the first of the new songs I’d written for the album, “Drink ‘Til You Die”, and “You’re Fucking Doomed”. I wanted to try some new arrangement things on Devastator and YFD, and instead of just rerecording over the same demo tracks I wanted to redo them a bit differently, thinking that full-on new recordings might light a fire under me and get me writing more new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I was still several years from being done even on my intended work trajectory of the time, and while Hartmuth didn’t like shorter releases I thought I needed some kind of intermediate release to keep the name alive. I considered some short release on UHR, or maybe approaching Gravewurm or another band who might be down for it to release a two-song split - I wasn’t sure and honstly didn’t care much what, but I wanted SOMETHING out in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in some of the packages I received for the BWV store in between I saw some of the Barbarian Wrath titles had some unlisted live tracks. Hart always liked packing CDs with unlisted extras, and I remember listening to &lt;em&gt;Heilig Vuur&lt;/em&gt; again around that time and I liked how he put live cuts from that unreleased Countess live album on the end of it. I had the full album, so I knew the source, but separated from the full live album it was neat to have these unconnected tracks that just seemed out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, one day during the summer I took my kids to swimming lessons, and I was sitting in a covered picnic area beside the pool with the other parents. I had a small notepad and pencil and would occasionally scribble down lyric or song ideas or attempt to tab any musical ideas I had. My mind wandered and all of the threads above came together at once - why not record these new tracks as ‘live’ tracks, along with one or two from the first album, so that they could be as bonus tracks for the new album? It gives me an excuse to rerecord the new-album demo tracks, faking them as live would force me to record them differently, and the momentum of recording anything would hopefully convert into forward momentum on more new music to finally finish the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I had this thought, another thought from back in my creative writing classes came up - it’s okay to leave ‘holes’ in the plot or character or other aspect of the story with regards to what you tell the reader, but there should NOT be holes in the story as the author perceives it. So, if I’m giving 2-3 live bonus tracks from a gig, what would be the full tracklist for the gig? So, I started coming up with a dream ‘wish list’ of a setlist for what a Death Beast show would contain, and I started toying with the idea of leaving in stage banter references to the last song or next song on the tracks, or maybe even putting in a few seconds of the end of the prior song… and then pretty quickly it just ballooned up into “Fuck it, we’ll just record a whole fucking live album.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I also had “Drink ‘til You Die” written at that time I didn’t think I could pull off the middle section ‘Teacher’s Pet’ break easily, so I only put “You’re Fucking Doomed” and “Devastator” into the mix, along with my favorite tracks from the first album. The Exodus cover came from one of those old late-night IRC chats way back in the early 2000s. Cesc from ReDimoni said he always liked that song and he thought Death Beast could do a good cover of it, so I threw it on. The Rampage song was, yet again, me trying to get a perfect version of “Gates of the Abyss” - I still missed it, but got a lot closer. Some of the solos were shitty but I much prefer the rewritten first verse. The medley of Slayer and Nasty Savage was a nod to the way so many 70s bands would have extended jam/solo sections in their gigs and they would sometimes cut into sections of songs - bleeding off of the ringing guitars into the open-e-chug at the start of “Black Magic” just felt right, and I always messed up in my head the bit after the solo - in Slayer, it’s in 16ths but whenever I play it I always go to triplets, which led to me thinking of “No Sympathy” by Nasty Savage, and the tempo and 12/8 drumbeat was right to cut over into the song “Death Beast”. And, to end where it begins, opening the gig with Priest’s “Rapid Fire” was directly inspired by how strong an opening it was at their 30th Anniversary British Steel gigs, and one thing I’d always wanted to do if I actually got into live performance again would be to always open a gig with a cover of something that other bands open with, a kind of heavy metal combination of tribute and Where’s Waldo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand in hand with the tracklist was the stage banter, as that is the main thing separating good bands from good live bands. I thought about my favorite bits from either my favorite live albums or gigs I’ve been to and scripted them in along with the track order. Then I had to figure out how to record it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started first by just worrying about the instrumental tracks. I got my drum programs set up song-by-song and then set about getting guitar and bass tones. The trick was going to be getting a rock-solid consistent sound track-to-track, so I used my Spider Amp and took photos of each knob setting, saving one preset for ‘Axe’ and one for ‘Vic’. I did try to not mess with volume settings, but I also double-checked this on the back end by using wave analysis on my recorded tracks to match the RMS volumes - probably more trouble than I needed to go through, but I wanted it consistent. When it came to recording, I practiced each track a few times and gave it a one-pass recording. I would rerecord a track from scratch if I really shit the bed on a take, but I didn’t mess with punchins or overdubs - just as if it were live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matching vocal tracks was going to be a lot harder going track-by-track, and especially so if I wanted crowd noise to fit. I somehow got the idea to just take my exported instrumental tracks back into a new audio file in Sonar and overdub my vocals there, so that I could also layer in crowd and sound effects. Then I also got the bright idea to give it even a bit more of the ‘recorded on the fly’ method by thinking about how some soundboard-live recordings are at the wrong speed and sound a bit sharp or flat because of it. Adding a touch of speed would help thrash metal sound more careening and out of control, I thought, so I sped up every instrumental track a 1/4 step, then imported that into my master mix file. I left the crowd noise at natural speed and recorded my vocals at natural speed, and only having to sing a 1/4 step sharp didn’t mess up my vocals too much. I layered in the first song, then appended the second song right at the end of that (after a few explosions, like the way Priest did at their British Steel Anniversary gigs). Piece by piece I ended up building a full, 56-minute single audio track that had all of the effects, all of the vocals, and all songs. Then, I exported the whole monster as if it were just a straight soundboard dump and clipped it just the way I’d done for dozens of bootlegs I grabbed off Dimeadozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make it sound like it happened fast, but the process overall took about two years between conception and final mixdown, and of course during that time was when Ramrod passed on. I wasn’t yet at the vocal stage yet, but when he did it was a no-brainer to add in some kind of tribute to him, and then in the kayfabe of the gig we could say it was organized on the one-year anniversary of his passing. I can’t remember now if I had already decided to do the trading-off vocals on “Here Comes the War” before then or not, but mentioning it in the stage banter was a given, as I felt like I had to pay some kind of tribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of times when I listen back to my own music I focus on the flubs and wish I’d done better on playing or recording them, but this is the one release I have where I’m happy about them. It really does give it the kind of ‘oh, this really IS live’ feeling. I’ve toyed with the idea of doing more ‘live gigs’ like this, if I can find a way to cut down on how much work it is. We’ll see what the future holds, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This End Down</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though it’s been out for about a month, this is the official (belated) notice for the release of Rampage’s newest album, &lt;em&gt;This End Down&lt;/em&gt;, a release that breaks my personal delay record with an interval of &lt;em&gt;SIXTEEN&lt;/em&gt; years between first conception and actual release. Despite that, the final release ended up much closer to the original conception than I could have imagined - some live/rehearsal-styled quick-and-dirty renditions of some of our strongest back-catalog songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed previously, the very first thing we did when we reunited earlier this year was the lead-off track “Rainbow Skies” for the rerecorded &lt;em&gt;Bellum Aeternum&lt;/em&gt;, but as we lined things up for what is coming next I reminded Aerik that I was still sitting on these tracks. They were done about the same time as the &lt;em&gt;BA&lt;/em&gt; tracks, late 2005 to early 2006, and in fact we had even tried to revive with them a couple of times in the intervening years - I even found an old email from about 2012 where I talk about sending these tracks to him again. Since ‘sending’ things now only involves upload and download time, not a trip to the post office and a week’s delay in the mail, he heard these and instantly said “We need to do this!” And, working a song a day, he was done in just over a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original conception was a set of rehearsal-style quick recordings - no overdubs, no punch-ins, just first/second-take live-styled recordings, warts and all, focusing on a few of the older songs that we felt were the strongest and that Aerik really wanted to take a crack at. He had picked a few of the fast ones off of &lt;em&gt;This End Up&lt;/em&gt;, along with him mentioning that he wanted to try his hand at singing a version of “Here Comes the War” since he had also written the lyrics on that one (and, after all, &lt;em&gt;War Never Changes…&lt;/em&gt;). I did this set first, just straight up in my regular D tuning just like the older stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, he wanted to try a few more of our doomier tracks, and since I had made the decision to tune down to C# for another release we were working on at the time, so in parallel to the &lt;em&gt;BA&lt;/em&gt; recordings I also knocked out some of the older songs from &lt;em&gt;Monolith&lt;/em&gt;, plus a sick C# version of “Displeasures…”, and even a Sabbath cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave the tracks a quick mix, not even bothering to take out the scrap noise before/after the songs, and committed them to master stereo exports which, a couple of mailed discs aside, proceeded to sit on my hard drive for 16 years. That is, of course, until Aerik and I resurrected them, and now you can buy them on Bandcamp or stream them on Spotify until your eardrums bleed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, despite the aforementioned warts and blemishes, we’re both very happy with what came out. My playing back then was nearly the best it’s ever been (topped probably only by my performance on the &lt;em&gt;BA&lt;/em&gt; recordings and, later, on &lt;em&gt;The Onslaught&lt;/em&gt;), and Aerik’s vocals have grown even more over the decade-and-a-half than I could have imagined. He doesn’t just sing these songs, he LIVES them - the anger on “Here Comes the War”, the fury on “Bloody Leg” and “Six Bells”, his Dickinson-on-steroids epic take on “Wanderlust”, and his absolutely SICK version of “Displeasures…” - this is the full fruition of what the 2004-2006 version of Rampage only hinted at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we still have an album and EP in the hopper, along with the new stuff we’re working on. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BACK FROM THE DEAD</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have already heard, but I’m making it official here. Rampage and Unsung Heroes Records are Back From The Dead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been 16 years since Aerik and I had worked together, and many years since we last talked, and that itself after several years of very sporadic contact. Each of us was working on our own musical and life paths and they simply diverged. It’s a fact of life that few like to dwell on, but sometimes people just move in ways that move them apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, another fact of life is that people can reconnect, and what they’ve learned and done along the way since last time can direct the future - and that is what has happened here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aerik messaged me out of the blue about a month ago, and then he started showing up in my Facebook feed, on Youtube, showcasing new music and new releases after quite a long time of (from my perspective, anyway) silence. He had taken the pandemic time to really dive into the a-to-z of doing the one-person studio project thing and had built up an impressive catalog of new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he wanted to give Rampage another shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve described the state of where we left things, when in 2006 I was looking at a long time of non-productivity due to life changes but I had built up a backlog of about four releases (depending how you count them) of things for Aerik to work on while I was out of commission. He got busy on his own things, and time slipped past as it usually does. The recordings, however, remained intact, and so currently he is working on realizing some of those projects: &lt;em&gt;Bellum Aeternum&lt;/em&gt; most notably, but also some rehearsals, an older rerecorded Rampage EP (that we may bypass except for a couple of tracks), and a newer EP but with rewritten lyrics (for the ones who remember, this would have been the “Misogyny II” EP, but neither of us are in that headspace anymore - same music, but new lyrics on a different topic). Some teasers are already out there, and I’ll be more active here telling you all about what’s coming up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’ve started working on the resurrection/re-animation of Unsung Heroes Records. I’ve put more of our back catalog on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://unsungheroesrecords.bandcamp.com&quot;&gt;Bandcamp page&lt;/a&gt; and our newer releases will show up there when we get them done. Always remaining on the bleeding edge of modern music, we’ve completed our transition from a CDR label to a full-on digital music supply service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Songwriting - The Wakening</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are no lyrics, of course, but no discussion of the first Death Beast album would be complete without discussing the creation of the introduction track “The Wakening”. Would you call an intro a ‘title track’? I don’t think of it as such, and to be honest I just think of it as ‘the intro’ because I didn’t really realize it when titling it that I had already used “The Wakening” as a song title before - for the acoustic+lead guitar intro to the song “Soulsword” from Rampage’s “Bellum Infinitum” album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title “The Wakening” came from some AIM discussions between me and Stan when we were coming up with ideas for songs and the album. Between the two of us we came up with the idea of doing at least three albums, and then naming them in sequence - “The Wakening”, “The Onslaught”, and “The Aftermath” - with the sequence of themes being obvious. And, in looking at the lyrics Stan wrote for the first album, he certainly held up his end of the bargain - every song has some kind of an ‘impending doom’ or ‘your destruction is on the way’ kind of feel to it, and it’s what I tried to keep up with on “The Onslaught” by making the destruction not impending but active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, instead of just blasting out of the gate on the first album, I knew I wanted to do some kind of intro, but clean guitars/acoustics weren’t the right feel and keyboards would not work, so I thought I’d go with some kind of lead guitar/guitar effects track - not actual music plus solos, but just noisemaking that had some kind of rhyme and reason to it. Aimless noodling wasn’t going to cut it, but a riff with solos would be too structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the same tool that helped me with layering backing vocals and the sound effects at the end of “Here Comes the War” ended up working perfectly - Sonic Foundry’s “Acid” looper. I had plenty of practice by doing the layering vocals for songs, whether just putting multiple vocal tracks together and in-sync or doing the more elaborate ‘growing army of the dead’ bit at the end of “Enslaved Cadavers”. I saw how I could add multiple tracks and mix them, and even mix single song-length tracks with looped repeating soundbytes, so I sat down and banged it all out in one evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start was the feedback - I just hit ‘record’ and held my guitar up to the computer speakers which were monitoring the amp and started that nice, clean feedback. I did a bit of gradually moving it back and forth for a touch of volume swelling, but basically just let it feed back for close to two minutes, at which point I pulled back all the way to stop and I left that as the first ‘base’ track. Next I laid down a second track of me recording in stereo a Slayer-esque cacophony of random chromatic picking, trills, pinch harmonics, whammy bar dives… I put Kerry King’s entire guitar &lt;em&gt;oeuvre&lt;/em&gt; from the first three Slayer albums into two minutes. Then, for a more fucked-up sound, I edited that stereo track in Sound Forge by taking one of the two channels and just reversing it completely - that way, instead of one stereo noise track, I had two completely different noise tracks panned hard-left/hard-right with one of them sounding ‘off’ by being backwards. Then, for even more of a cacophonous sound, I recorded another guitar track of me doing high unison bends, bending both to perfect pitch and just a bit flat, kinda like Quorthon’s leads on the song “Blood Fire Death”. I just stayed on the one note through the whole track, then I edited it by fading up at the start and down at the end, and I auto-set the pan to slowly take it from center to hard-left, then slowly to hard-right, and just slowly back and forth until the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixing that together left me with something cacophonous and nearly amorphous, but with JUST enough structure to not be pointless. I still felt it needed something, though, and that’s when thinking back again to the “Enslaved Cadavers” outro gave me the idea to add more horror to it by adding some vocals. I started going back to the other vocal tracks on the album and cutting out particularly good screams and shouts. Then, I would make copies of them and start playing with them - pitch-shift up, or pitch-shift down, or reversing them, or leaving them in stereo and swapping phase so they sound bizarre, and just pasting those in. Then I started cutting out a couple of vocal lines and adding those, also manipulated in the same ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then another idea hit me and I started recording some spoken lines - I’d say things like ‘death beast’ or ‘hell’ or other random words or short phrases from the lyrics. Some of these I would just slow down and paste in. Others I would reverse and put in backwards. On a couple, I reversed the line just to hear what it sounded like backwards, then I recorded myself speaking them by phonetically trying to copy the backwards speech, then reversing that fake-reverse to get something that sounded forward, but ‘off’. I also recorded one little ‘secret’ in there, pitch shifted WAY down and reversed - the cat’s out of the bag on that one so it’s not really ‘secret’ anymore, but I wonder if anyone picked it out back at the time, or will bother doing so now. Do people still try to play their metal albums backwards for the hidden messages?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lyrics - Here Comes the War</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Between the two emails of lyrics from Dementor we had lyrics for eight Death Beast songs, which I had counted as enough for our first album. But, as it turned out, I ended up writing another one - “Here Comes the War”. This one was unique in that, unlike other Death Beast songs but like many of my Rampage songs, I wrote the music first. In fact, I didn’t even have any lyrics or title for it - just an idea of the feel that I wanted, which was something in “F#”. Actually E, since I tune down a whole step, but you know what I mean - rooted in the thrash tradition of the root being on the second fret, and getting the 7th-root movement by hammering on from open to 2nd fret, something like “Trapped Under Ice”, the pre-chorus to “South of Heaven”, or the main riff to the song “Exodus”. In fact, that song was literally the inspiration for it, to the point that the original filename for it was “xodus_fl.sng” - “Exodus-feel song”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across the main riff while trying to write something like the verse riff of “Exodus”, 7th-to-root by hammering on and then going to the tritone for accents, but tweaked it with the hammer-pull-off riff to get its own flavor. A little more playing got me to the descending chromatics for the chorus parts, but I tried to break up the samey-ness by making one repeat a whole step higher and going from straight-8th-based descents to 3-on-2 triplets. I also stepped up the solo sections another whole step and put each solo section a fourth apart, going A-B-A-Harmony for the soloists (another nod to Dark Angel’s “Death is Certain”, which uses the same solo arrangement - I’ve done that quite a bit, now that I think about it…), and then a ‘chorus riff’ with just vocal screams and solos instead of a fully-sung chorus. Again, all pretty standard, but I tried to change a few things to give it a bit of a different feel. When I sent the last set of music to Stan for his ill-fated final vocal sessions (the ones where Dementor’s computer blew up and he ended up deciding to quit Death Beast) I sent this one along, asking him to try to come up with a title and write one more song’s worth of lyrics for it. I don’t know if he ever did write anything, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally got Ramrod to join Death Beast he heard the instrumental version of it and liked it. We were chatting on AIM and he said he already had an idea for it - the title would be “Here Comes the War”, and that would be repeated in the chorus. He said he’d need a bit to come up with the lyrics, though. Just before Ramrod joined, though, I had asked Aerik to join Death Beast on vocals. He declined, as he was already singing for Rampage and didn’t want to have it sound the same, but he wasn’t opposed to writing lyrics for me. Well, Ramrod was also working with Aerik on the Von Frankensteins and so the two of them put their heads together for lyrics on “Here Comes the War”, and of course by now you all know what they came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Feel the heat, the burning streets as bullets rape the air
The bombs will fly and men will die and nobody will care
But empty heads obsessed with death just so afraid to die
A protest here – just built on fear and tears the cowards cry
But in the trench or on the bench the others hide from heroes ends
Insurgents rise to spite the lives of a reign come to an end
Roadside bombs like horrid songs explode with living hell
The war still lost, but keeps the costs of lives where soldiers fell

Here comes the Pain - Here comes the War
Drives you insane - Here comes the war
Pray for your death - Here comes the war
Take your last breath - Here comes the war

The flag is torn, weakened and worn being burned by those we &quot;saved&quot;
The soilders grind against the tide in lands that rest untamed
In the name of God, the killing dog who spurs them to attack
From friends to foes to silent death, the blade against the back
From desert sands, by foreign hands, the gates of hell tear free
Chemical war, the silent whore, may spread it's misery
We took the throne but now lay prone for the God and his mad slaves
The war won't end till all lay dead and rot in nameless graves

Here comes the Pain - Here comes the War
Drives you insane - Here comes the war
Pray for your death - Here comes the war
Take your last breath - Here comes the war

The tanks are burned, and overturned, the cities smoke and ash
To save the mind, the killing kind, false peace the aftermath
Our bitter mold, a social gold, forced down upon the tribe
A despot king to justice bring but we failed to save the lives
And now we're here, still torn by fear, fighting street to street
The war still hot, the &quot;peace&quot; that's not, but death you get to keep
The fire ceased – so soon released, the war will not subside
When soilders trained take on the rage it's the fate of man to die

Here comes the Pain - Here comes the War
Drives you insane - Here comes the war
Pray for your death - Here comes the war
Take your last breath - Here comes the war
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were perfect, and as such they never changed through Ryan’s fortunately-surviving demo version, the album version on &lt;em&gt;The Wakening&lt;/em&gt;, or any of the live versions after that. Swapping off the vocals on the live version was just a way to add some color to the live album as well as to pay tribute to Ramrod. The idea came from Desaster’s “Metalized Blood”, in the way that they had three guest vocalists to sing one each of the three verses. It’s a shame we didn’t get to do more writing together, because this one came together really easily and I think it’s one of the better songs from the first album.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lyrics - Invoking Villainy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last song I wrote with Dementor for Death Beast, “Invoking Villainy”, was sent along with “Enslaved Cadavers” after we had already written the first six songs from that initial email. As with “Enslaved Cadavers” he never got a chance to record any vocals for it, so I wonder what he would have ultimately done. As it was, it was pretty sparse with only two short verses and two short choruses, plus a tag line, so I knew I’d have to add some more musical content somehow to get it to full-song length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Whispers turn to screams in the black mass
Orgies of fiends in the black mass
Sacrifice for sin in the black mass
Nothing is forbidden in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Black Mass Insanity

Scourging virgins in the black mass
Raping purity in the black mass
Only sinners survive the black mass
All others die in the black mass

Invoking Villainy
Conjuring Devilry
Invoking Villainy
Satanic Insanity

...the Black Mass!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constant repeats of ‘black mass’ at the end of each verse line, along with the very similar short vocal lines for the choruses, pointed to something that would lend itself to a chant-type of feel. As such, my options were to find exactly the right riff that would lend itself to repetition without being boring or to build something elaborate with a lot of musical sections and changes with just not that much singing. My first thought was the latter, and thus I started trying every kind of riff in the world, finding stuff I could build together to build a monster of a song - perhaps along the lines of “Live Undead” by Slayer, which was my first thought, or “No Love” by Exodus. I tried for weeks to get anything that would work on its own or that I could get to gel into a bigger structure from smaller riffs, but nothing worked for the heavy section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I also thought I could do kind of a clean intro piece with some noodling solos, perhaps like Testament’s “Musical Dirge” or some of the clean intros they had on other songs on that album. In that vein I played a bit and came up with what you all now know as the clean intro, “Psychosis” - it’s a simple Dm-Abm-Eb5-repeat, with a minor 3-minor-2-root every fourth repeat for the turnaround, that uses my love of simple half-step changes resulting in large chord changes. While the rest of the song languished, I got the intro totally fleshed out. It’s a rhythm that can be played completely in the low-open position and up an octave in the 7th position, and it lends itself well to just being arpeggiated clean or having the arpeggios be played over ringing open distorted chords. I worked out the arrangement for the progression of heaviness and wrote a solo that I was happy with, but then when it ended I didn’t know what to do…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… until I realized that I should have taken my first option with the meat of the song. On a lark I tried just doing a thrash-style gallop on those chords over the open low D and BOOM! - that was the trick. The riff ended up being perfect for the verses - repetitive in a way I like to think goes more towards ‘hypnotic trance’ than ‘unimaginative repeating’ - hammering on the dissonance of the tritone and minor second, along with the ringing chords allowing for bass fills every fourth repeat, makes it nice and compact, and with the song length padded by the intro I could make it a short, fast banger. The chorus part came from just using simple chromatics - it’s the same half-step walkdown as the ‘chorus’ riff in Sabbath’s “Into the Void”, just thrashed up and in a different key (I tune to D, they tuned to C#), with the D-Eb at the very end with a stop leading right back into the next verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had those two parts I just slammed them together - V-C-V-C, with the solo leading to the outro next. For the solo, I kept half the same verse riff, but used riffs to connect the chord alterations (D to C, a good solid minor-key classic for soloing). I tried pulling out all the stops, even going so far as to work in a tapping descending arpeggio which is so far outside of my usual solo wheelhouse it’s not even funny. It worked, though, adding just a bit more difference to the solos on the album as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still not sure how I came up with the ending. I think I had just decided somewhere along the way that I would try to work in bits where I juxtapose major and minor from the same key into the same riff or song, and that’s where the notes I used for those riffs came from - in Dm for the song as a whole, the chords at the end are Gb and F, with A as a single note in between. I liked the sound of the intervals but didn’t know what to do with them, so I thought I’d just slow down and let them ring out, which is exactly what I ended up doing once I heard how it played out. I was also especially happy how the solo blended into that ending progression, since I accidentally just ended up trilling on the same notes. I did that on the demo version, then forgot it, and when I was recording this for the final album version I remember I had to go back and re-figure-out what I had done back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of progression from demo to final version, there was no real change in arrangement, but I did do some playing with instrumentation. On the demo I just did one clean guitar in the low octave for the intro, but I wanted it to have a bit more sparkle, so I used two clean guitar tracks, one playing in the low open position and one an octave higher as I described above. I piled on some chorus and then panned the two tracks hard left and hard right - I think it sounds like you’re inside the middle of a 12-string guitar that way, which is neat while the cleans are playing alone but they still got a bit lost in the mix when the heavy guitars came in. Oh well - it’s a learning process and I’m still overall pretty happy with how this one turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Not Dead Yet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess I shouldn’t be surprised to be here. After just refreshing myself with my own blog’s history, and thus the numerous times I ‘get back to blogging’ and then let it go months between updates, I shouldn’t be surprised that I did it again, nor should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s that ‘blank page’ syndrome, I guess, combined with the timelessness of this COVID era, that makes it seem like time just melts like ice cream on asphalt on a hot summer day. “What’s one more day to think of where to start?” I tell myself, and then I blink and it’s six weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s no cure for it but to just pick up with where I left off. I was telling the story of Death Beast “The Onslaught” (which is now two and a half years old?!?!?) in broad terms while catching people up on songwriting posts about the first album’s songs, which would lead to the second. I guess I also need to cover the ‘live’ album at some point, and maybe Festering Sore’s history as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, all that’s coming. Next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, really.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OK, NOW We Are Back...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, as you can see, it took a little longer than I thought to actually get it back online. I thought the website-build irregularities were due to it just being local and not online - instead, it was that all the code was fucked up because I moved it on my local machine and Github’s desktop app and Jekyll in general don’t like things moved after they’re built in a specific place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it took me about a week to figure out how to move things to the right spot, then migrate all the template changes from what I’d done before to the new, properly placed template. Then, of course, Gremlins (as there always seem to be with anything more complicated than an abacus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I’ve defeated all problems and Gremlins and now you can read about this in all its glory. As well as catch up on what I’ve been up to since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND, bonus for all of you hoping for more frequent updates, this new Jekyll-built markdown blog really IS much easier to post in, now that I’m used to the way the workflow goes, so I should be able to update this more frequently. And, with this gigantic rock out of my shoe, next step - more music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT music I’m not sure, but anything’s better than nothing, right? Besides, does anyone out there really like one of my bands and hate the others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Don’t answer that - I’m not sure I want to know…)&lt;/p&gt;
