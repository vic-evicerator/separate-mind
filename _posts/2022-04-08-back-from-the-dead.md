Some of you may have already heard, but I'm making it official here. Rampage and Unsung Heroes Records are Back From The Dead!

It had been 16 years since Aerik and I had worked together, and many years since we last talked, and that itself after several years of very sporadic contact. Each of us was working on our own musical and life paths and they simply diverged. It's a fact of life that few like to dwell on, but sometimes people just move in ways that move them apart.

But, another fact of life is that people can reconnect, and what they've learned and done along the way since last time can direct the future - and that is what has happened here.

Aerik messaged me out of the blue about a month ago, and then he started showing up in my Facebook feed, on Youtube, showcasing new music and new releases after quite a long time of (from my perspective, anyway) silence. He had taken the pandemic time to really dive into the a-to-z of doing the one-person studio project thing and had built up an impressive catalog of new music.

And he wanted to give Rampage another shot.

Of course, I said yes.

I've described the state of where we left things, when in 2006 I was looking at a long time of non-productivity due to life changes but I had built up a backlog of about four releases (depending how you count them) of things for Aerik to work on while I was out of commission. He got busy on his own things, and time slipped past as it usually does. The recordings, however, remained intact, and so currently he is working on realizing some of those projects: _Bellum Aeternum_ most notably, but also some rehearsals, an older rerecorded Rampage EP (that we may bypass except for a couple of tracks), and a newer EP but with rewritten lyrics (for the ones who remember, this would have been the "Misogyny II" EP, but neither of us are in that headspace anymore - same music, but new lyrics on a different topic). Some teasers are already out there, and I'll be more active here telling you all about what's coming up.

Also, I've started working on the resurrection/re-animation of Unsung Heroes Records. I've put more of our back catalog on our [Bandcamp page](http://unsungheroesrecords.bandcamp.com) and our newer releases will show up there when we get them done. Always remaining on the bleeding edge of modern music, we've completed our transition from a CDR label to a full-on digital music supply service.
