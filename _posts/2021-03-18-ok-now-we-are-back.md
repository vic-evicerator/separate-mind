Well, as you can see, it took a little longer than I thought to actually get it back online. I thought the website-build irregularities were due to it just being local and not online - instead, it was that all the code was fucked up because I moved it on my local machine and Github's desktop app and Jekyll in general don't like things moved after they're built in a specific place.

So, it took me about a week to figure out how to move things to the right spot, then migrate all the template changes from what I'd done before to the new, properly placed template. Then, of course, Gremlins (as there always seem to be with anything more complicated than an abacus).

But, I've defeated all problems and Gremlins and now you can read about this in all its glory. As well as catch up on what I've been up to since 2004.

AND, bonus for all of you hoping for more frequent updates, this new Jekyll-built markdown blog really IS much easier to post in, now that I'm used to the way the workflow goes, so I should be able to update this more frequently. And, with this gigantic rock out of my shoe, next step - more music.

WHAT music I'm not sure, but anything's better than nothing, right? Besides, does anyone out there really like one of my bands and hate the others?

(Don't answer that - I'm not sure I want to know...)
