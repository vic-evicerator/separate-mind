I guess I shouldn't be surprised to be here. After just refreshing myself with my own blog's history, and thus the numerous times I 'get back to blogging' and then let it go months between updates, I shouldn't be surprised that I did it again, nor should you.

Again, it's that 'blank page' syndrome, I guess, combined with the timelessness of this COVID era, that makes it seem like time just melts like ice cream on asphalt on a hot summer day. "What's one more day to think of where to start?" I tell myself, and then I blink and it's six weeks later.

Well, there's no cure for it but to just pick up with where I left off. I was telling the story of Death Beast "The Onslaught" (which is now two and a half years old?!?!?) in broad terms while catching people up on songwriting posts about the first album's songs, which would lead to the second. I guess I also need to cover the 'live' album at some point, and maybe Festering Sore's history as well.

Well, all that's coming. Next week.

No, really.
